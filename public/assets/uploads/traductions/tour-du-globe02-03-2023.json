Gondola rides, the Venice Carnival, the Doge's Palace, St. Mark's Basilica, a stay in Venice on the Adriatic Sea always has a special dimension. In the lagoon, there are also a few small islands whose names are known to all,<em> Burano<\/em> and Murano. The latter, the capital of glass and crystal, should definitely be on your list of visits.<!--more--><h2>What is the island of Murano?<\/h2>\nMurano is a small island north of the city of Venice, just over one square kilometer. It is known for being the place of production of <em>Venetian<\/em> glass, whose centuries-old know-how allows for the production of high quality glass and crystal. Many glass factories can be visited with a guided tour, demonstration of technical mastery, tools, and a visit to the stores of course. Beyond glass, Murano is a Venice on a smaller scale with beautiful gardens, the glass museum, the canals that divide the city into small neighborhoods and very elegant buildings in the Venetian style.<h2>The history of Murano<\/h2>\nThe history of Murano is intertwined with the history of glass production, since it was at the very beginning of the 13th century that Venice imposed by decree the installation of glass furnaces in Murano, to protect Venice from fires. Great families of master glassmakers have succeeded one another on the island and today there are still a hundred or so master glassmakers who constitute the island's priceless heritage in terms of know-how.<h2>The specialty of the island: the famous Murano crystal<\/h2>\nIf Murano is a small island full of charm, people come to it for its crystal. It is almost a must when you take the time to discover Venice over several days. In Murano, as soon as you leave the landing stage of the vaporetto that will have taken you across the lagoon, you will already be approached by touts. They come to convince you to come and visit their workshop rather than the one next door, and the truth is that it is indeed a visit that you should not miss. Unless you have already seen the work of a glassblower, you will discover an activity that is both surprising and exciting. Whatever glass factory you choose, you will be shown the workshop where, in a part reserved for tourist discovery, a master glassblower will demonstrate his know-how. Raw material brought to a very high temperature, <strong>glass blowing<\/strong>, handling of great dexterity, you will remain speechless in front of the talent of these men who, with a few skilful gestures, make small subjects, glass beads or decorative objects before your eyes. You will see only a glimpse of the techniques and the many skills required to master the art of glassmaking, but even if you have not come for an advanced course, you will be surprised by this <strong>art<\/strong>. Inevitably, the second part of the visit concerns the store. The glassmakers are still waiting for you to make a purchase that will make your heart beat faster. If the approach is legitimate for a small souvenir, keep in mind that it is not the best place for more important purchases such as <em>tableware<\/em>, beautiful decorative objects or a <em>chandelier<\/em>[caption id=\"attachment_542\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<img class=\"wp-image-542 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/oyvcs0oj.tour-du-globe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/cristal-murano-300x204.jpg\" alt=\"cristal murano\" width=\"300\" height=\"204\" \/> Murano and its colors[\/caption] Indeed, you will not have any hindsight after your first visit to the island to compare both the creations of the different glassmakers, but also the prices. This last remark is all the more valid as Murano crystal can be found today all over the world, and that they are authentic products. It is therefore much easier, far from the tourist hype, to think about your purchases. Going to a store or another internet site is undoubtedly the best way to discover, in the calm of your home and not in a crowded store, the know-how of craftsmen who have been exporting their creativity all over the world for several centuries. To offer yourself glass or crystal from Murano is to make yourself a priceless gift. Beyond its market value, it is the pleasure of a handmade object, unique, of which one could see with his eyes the manufacturing process. Relying on a Murano glass dealer allows you to find quality in a calm environment and without the sometimes misleading excitement of a workshop visit. But don't panic, you don't necessarily have to go there to find these kinds of treasures.

Do not miss the monolithic temples better known as \"five Ratha\". They are real treasures built in homage to deities: Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Indra, and Durga.

The most popular social networks like Instagram allow them to share their opinions on a specific topic and affect people's perception of the topic they are dealing with. The more important their online activities are, the more their publications will act on the behaviors of their followers. By principle, a travel influencer can therefore positively or negatively impact the appreciation of the destinations he mentions on his page. Influencers can be solicited by travel professionals to help them improve their brand image. They become real ambassadors to promote a destination, an establishment or services intended for travelers.<h2>Breathtaking photos<\/h2>\nThe quality of images is essential to present destinations to Internet users. Managing the luminosity and contrasts brings depth to the photos. The beauty of the setting is highlighted and will encourage your subscribers to discover the places you present by themselves. Remember to use a camera with an excellent resolution. Don't hesitate to invest in a semi-pro camera to make impactful photos. A mid-range or high-end <em>smartphone<\/em> is a good alternative, as it provides you with powerful sensors and photo editing applications at your fingertips. It's handy for correcting, retouching, adding effects, filters and text instantly to your posts, before putting them online.<h2>A consistent feed is essential<\/h2>\nAs for digital marketing, a consistent graphic charter is an effective tool to create attractive visuals. To have a nice <em>feed<\/em>, don't hesitate to play with the framing, the colors, the formats and the filters. Harmonize your content by keeping certain parameters. Among other things, you can choose black and white photos to give your photos a nostalgic or ethereal look. There is also the possibility to compose them under natural light to bring out the colors.<h2>Buy followers<\/h2>\nYou should know that the number of followers and their engagement on a page is a good indicator of the notoriety of an influencer. Indeed, Internet users pay more attention to the most followed pages. Creating a community and gaining followers is the first step to becoming an influencer. Posting regularly will attract your target audience to your page. You will gradually build a community of travel enthusiasts. To gain visibility and develop your reputation, it is also possible to<strong>buy followers on Instagram<\/strong>. This is a service that is offered in particular by the website <a href=\"https:\/\/www.premlike.com\/\">premlike.<\/a> com and that allows you to become an <em>Instagram influencer<\/em> quickly. Different solutions with a defined volume of likes, followers or views to fit the needs of influencers are available to you. Depending on your needs, you can buy followers to improve your positioning in the travel industry, or views on your content and photos to generate engagement.<h2>Think about your hashtags<\/h2>\nYou can add up to 30 <em>hashtags <\/em>on Instagram posts. Intended to help users find content, they should be selected carefully to gain visibility. To promote your ideas, choose them in a way that generates neither too much nor too little search volume; the most popular ones offer the most results. Your publications risk being drowned out by many others. Also consider the relationships between brands when putting together the combinations. There are recurring hashtags for each theme. This will increase your chances of appearing in the most relevant search results.<h2>Showcase destinations to your community<\/h2>\nAn Instagram page dedicated to travel should encourage users to visit the destinations you're talking about. Showcase the assets of the region, country or city by focusing your photos and videos on its special features. Plan your publications in order to arouse the curiosity of your subscribers and to interact with the community. The presentation of the <strong>destination<\/strong> can be the object of an influence campaign. The blogger implements a web marketing strategy to select the photos and define their order of publication in order to hold the attention of her subscribers.<h2>Share your travel tips as much as possible<\/h2>\nA travel influencer can be involved in all aspects of the industry. In addition to posts on urban or natural <em>landscapes <\/em>, it is possible to propose practical tips to organize your trip. You can mention on your Instagram page the means of transportation or accommodation solutions most used in the destination. Focus on the options you have tested. Do not hesitate to talk about your good deals to get the cheapest train or plane tickets, the best restaurants where you ate. Also share the hotels that are suitable for different categories of travelers (family, singles, groups of friends,...). This type of sharing gives you the opportunity to create partnerships with travel professionals. Influencers can thus become ambassadors of a hotel chain for example. They can then benefit from privileged services in exchange for positive feedback on the establishment.<h2>Get off the beaten track<\/h2>\nThere are countless travel influencers on Instagram. Some position themselves as experts for a specific destination, others prefer to offer a broader opinion by being <strong>globetrotters<\/strong>. Either way, it's important to offer original content. After the most beautiful destinations, Internet users generally look for places off the beaten track in priority. Dare to promote places still preserved from mass tourism or propose an unusual experience such as sleeping under the stars in the desert.<h2>Participate in events<\/h2>\nAuthenticity is an essential element to stand out as a travel influencer. It is therefore important to promote the human dimension by meeting the actors of this sector. Travel shows, conferences and events will allow you to interact directly with your community, and you can partner with other travel influencers to increase the reach of your posts. Then share your experience on your Instagram account to show your engagement. You'll mutually benefit from each other's follower engagement and increase your audience.<h2>Don't forget to do stories<\/h2>\nIn terms of posting, stories have the highest <strong>visibility<\/strong> on Instagram. They are followed by both your followers and non-subscribers, which maximizes your visibility. In stories, you can post lives about places you visit and events you attend, among others. You can also encourage your followers to react through polls. This feature is handy to better identify your followers' expectations regarding destinations to discover, hobbies they are interested in.<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-608\" src=\"http:\/\/oyvcs0oj.tour-du-globe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/voyage-avion.jpg\" alt=\"voyage avion\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" \/>In short, identifying the influence you want to have on travel enthusiasts is the first step to embrace this activity.

Also, remember to spray a good repellent all over your body, but also to check the condition of your tent or the mosquito nets in your room to avoid being bitten at night (the time of day most likely to be bitten by mosquitoes).<h2>Don't overload yourself<\/h2>\nYou will usually go on your photo safari in a 4x4. This practical and powerful vehicle is an ideal way to get around in the bush, but it has little space for luggage. So, don't overload yourself, and keep your luggage small.

Let's take a few examples. The illuminations and the magical windows of Saint-Tropez are famous, and honor the Provencal traditions during the whole month of December, with the added bonus of an ice rink, horse-drawn carriage rides, and gourmet chalets. It is when the summer tourists have left that the islands of the French Riviera reveal all their splendor: go to Porquerolles, Port-Cros, Saint-Marguerite, Bendor, Les Embiez or Saint-Honorat! Porquerolles, with its beautiful beaches and hiking trails, or Port-Cros, are best enjoyed in the low season. In Saint-Honorat, you will see the monastery, and its vineyards. Perhaps, on the island of Sainte-Marguerite, off Cannes, you will meet the ghost of the iron mask, who was imprisoned there for eleven years. The landscape is especially beautiful with a multitude of sea birds: grebes, gulls, great egrets and grey herons.

You still have to find something to do and make good memories. For that, the French Riviera is there for you. Start with the museums, which promise not only enjoyable visits, but varied and of a very high standard. The Matisse Museum of the city of Nice, located at 64, Avenue des Ar\u00e8nes de <em>Cimiez<\/em>, offers a superb collection of the eponymous artist, as well as many other important American and European artists. The Marc Chagall National Museum, on Avenue Docteur M\u00e9nard in Nice, has the particularity of proposing a creative journey and playful animations accessible to children from the age of 5. A little secret between friends: the museum's refreshment bar, with its small fast-food facilities, set in a Mediterranean garden rich in olive trees, cypresses and other pines, is simply divine. In the pretty town of Biot, also famous for its local glassworks, you will visit the Fernand L\u00e9ger national museum, located in Chemin du Val de P\u00f4me. To discover another kind of modern painting in sunny Nice, don't miss the Mus\u00e9e d'Art Na\u00eff Anatole Jakovsky, in the Ch\u00e2teau Sainte H\u00e9l\u00e8ne (accessible by tramway on line 2: Fabron stop). The Nice region also boasts the Picasso Museum in Antibes, which overlooks the sea, and the Palais Lascaris in Nice, which dates back to 1648. Decorated with gilding, paintings, period furniture, and rich with one of the most important collections of old musical instruments in Europe. Located at 15 rue Droite in Nice, it is accessible by tramway, line 1 at the Cath\u00e9drale-Vieille Ville or Garibaldi stop, or line 2 at the <strong>Garibaldi<\/strong> Le Ch\u00e2teau stop. For a dive into the beauty of the underwater world, the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco, located on avenue Saint Martin, is well worth a visit. Its thousands of aquatic residents, spread over 90 basins, are a real treat for the eyes. They also learn to know and protect the oceans. In addition, a new space of the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco presents, on 550 m2, the odyssey of underwater turtles: fascinating.<h2>Hiking in the French Riviera, walks in an exceptional landscape<\/h2>\nThe C\u00f4te d'Azur is particularly rich in opportunities for walks and outdoor visits. You don't have to go far to find yourself in the middle of nature. The Honor\u00e9 d'Estienne d'Orves departmental nature park is located in the very heart of Nice. It stretches to the top of the Corniche de Magnan and overlooks the Baie des Anges. The Jardin des Ar\u00e8nes de Cimiez dominates the hill of the same name, and also offers beautiful walks in the shade of century-old olive trees. On the heights of Nice, in the heart of a vegetation made of umbrella pines and Aleppo pines, carob trees and wild olive trees, orchids and irises, take the trails that lead to <strong>Mont Boron<\/strong> and the Fort of Mont Alban, at 223 meters above sea level. Once you reach the top, you will enjoy a breathtaking view of the Baie des Anges. Then, walk on the trails of the Esterel Natural Park. Very popular with hikers, it is distinguished by its red rocks of volcanic origin. On 959 hectares, between Mandelieu-La-Napoule and Th\u00e9oule-sur-Mer, you can find lavender of the Maures, immortelle of the sands, and sometimes some rare orchids. You can see many sea birds, like terns and gulls. Between the groves of yellow broom, you may find the last species of wild tortoise existing in France, the Hermann tortoise. You will be able to walk to the Mont Saint Martin, or to the Rocher des Monges, or to climb the Sommet des Petites et Grosses Grues. Nearby, in Th\u00e9oule-sur-mer, the Pointe de l'Aiguille Natural Park unfolds its red rocks that plunge into the sea. Its paths allow you to walk along the cliffs, in a superb landscape. From the Belvedere, you will have a view of the entire Gulf of La Napoule. The Valmasque Park, a large forest park of 428 hectares, is located between Valbonne and Mougins, and offers many exciting trails. It is rich in discovery trails, a magnificent forest of pines and oaks, a pond adorned with water lilies, and even trails for bicycles and mountain bikes. To the north and west of Sophia-Antipolis, take the paths of the La Brague Nature Park, which covers 633 hectares. Following the waters of La Brague, you will probably see moorhens, ducks and woodcock, or even herons. 20 km from Nice, for hikers and mountain bikers alike, the ascent of Mont Macaron, at 806 meters, offers a breath of fresh air. Near Ch\u00e2teauneuf-Villevieille, you will see the ruins of the old village, abandoned in the 17th century, and the castle on the heights.<h2>Its ski resorts, for a friendly, warm and sporty winter!<\/h2>\nOnly an hour's drive from Nice, don't miss the resort of La Colmiane, with 30 kilometers of well-made <strong>ski<\/strong> runs, served by 6 ski lifts including 1 chairlift. The largest zip line in France, with a total length of 2,663 meters, is located at La Colmiane! Another good idea, another possibility of discovery, the resort of Valberg is located one hour and 15 minutes from Nice, in the heart of the Mercantour massif: it's the next door! This winter sports resort includes the communes of Guillaumes, P\u00e9one and Beuil. You will enjoy its ski area of about 50 downhill ski slopes, the snow park, 3 cross-country ski slopes, the covered and heated swimming pool, the snowmobile circuits, and 4 snowshoeing trails. Less than an hour and a half from Nice, you also have the resort of Auron, with its 46 downhill ski slopes, at an altitude of 1,600 meters and at the gates of the Mercantour National Park. These are three remarkable resorts among others... We won't lie to ourselves: after a good day of skiing in the open air, what a pleasure it is to enjoy a good fondue, a raclette, accompanied by a mulled wine, or a chocolate with kirsch! One should never sulk in pleasure. But La Colmiane, Vlaberg and Auron were only three examples, among others...<h2>Its mountains, magical and rich of a preserved fauna and flora<\/h2>\nThe <strong>Mercantour National Park<\/strong> extends over 28 communes... If you are lucky, you will be able to see ibexes, chamois and mouflons, as well as ermines and marmots, among others.<h2>The Christmas markets, the time of festivities and enchantment<\/h2>\nAre you in the mood for illuminations, chocolates and mulled wine, waffles... a slide on the ice rink and a nice visit to Santa Claus' village? To enjoy all the joys of the end of the year, the French Riviera offers, under a particularly good climate, many festivities and beautiful walks, with family or friends, in the Christmas markets.\n\nThe city of Cannes traditionally opens the ball at the end of November, but it is closely followed by the Christmas markets of Cagnes-sur-Mer, Monaco, Nice and Menton, from the beginning of December, then by Antibes, around December 15, to make the magic of Christmas reign until January. It is the ideal opportunity to enjoy the spirit of Christmas, from one end of the region to the other. However, the Christmas<em> village<\/em> of Nice is probably the biggest, with about sixty food and craft chalets, a Ferris wheel, an open-air skating rink, a giant crib with life-size automatons, musical entertainment, shows for all, or magic shows, free of charge and outdoors in the afternoons. There are even open-air movie nights. But that's not all.<h2>Its festivals, flowery, colorful, and so joyful<\/h2>\nAmong the events not to be missed, in winter, on the French Riviera, there is also the Carnival of Nice, the Lemon Festival in <strong>Menton<\/strong>, and the Mimosa Festival in Mandelieu-La Napoule. This is the winning trio, to enjoy the local joie de vivre, and the local flavors.<h3>The famous Nice Carnival, a must!<\/h3>\nImagine: one of the three biggest carnivals in the world, hundreds of thousands of spectators from all over the world, a thousand dancers and musicians in costumes, in a word a breathtaking winter fairy tale, during two weeks in February. You will be able to admire unforgettable giant parades along the waterfront, with twenty floats throwing thousands of flowers. Every year, his majesty Carnival takes over the keys of the city on the place Mass\u00e9na, and announces the reign of the ephemeral, the party and the joy, for 15 days of madness. Confettis, flowers and streamers shoot out from everywhere. At the end the King's float is burned. The carnival of Nice, you must see it once in your life!<h3>The festival of lemons<\/h3>\n[caption id=\"attachment_637\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-637\" src=\"http:\/\/oyvcs0oj.tour-du-globe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/menton-fete-citron.jpg\" alt=\"menton fete citron\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/> The Lemon Festival of Menton is a spectacle to behold.[\/caption] Imagine more than 200,000 visitors, who come each year to admire a particularly atypical carnival, a lemon yellow carnival, full of vitamins and joie de vivre. For more than 15 days, day and night, Menton is a parade of floats decorated with lemons and oranges, which originated in the 1920s, when the city was the first European producer of lemons. So even today, enjoy this wild carnival bright yellow, with its beautiful parades of twenty floats made up of citrus, its night lighting and festive, its fireworks at nightfall. Between February and the beginning of March, it is an explosion of fruity fantasy in the whole city. Parades of sumptuous floats, musicians, dancers, everything is there, for the pleasure of the eyes. It's pure joy: why deprive yourself?<h3>Every year in February, the mimosa festival<\/h3>\nBut you haven't seen everything. <strong>Mandelieu-La Napoule<\/strong> is a pretty town located on the seaside, south of Nice and not far from <strong>Cannes<\/strong>. It is here, on this sunny coast even in winter, that the stunning Mimosa Festival takes place every year. The mimosa was introduced in the country in 1839, imported from Australia, at the time a British colony. The mimosa made the region's fortune. Even today, two million stems are harvested each year. To honor this tree and its delicate flowers, a sumptuous street festival has been organized since 1931. It is not, far from it, a small confidential festival: each year, local producers provide 12 tons of flowers for the decoration of the floats and the flower battles... this gives an idea of the extraordinary atmosphere that makes the whole city vibrate during two weeks.\n\nWhether you go to the carnival or not, the surrounding hills will offer you a hundred scented escapades, between Bormes-les-Mimosas and Grasse, passing by Mandelieu. There is so much to do and see on the French Riviera in winter! You'll come to enjoy it, and, for sure, you'll come back!"},"translate-24":{"url":"cet-ete-direction-tenerife","title":"Vacation in Tenerife","h1":"This summer, direction Tenerife!","contenu":"You are looking for a sunny destination for your next summer <strong>vacation<\/strong>, but you want a destination with a change of scenery and a lively life?

You can look for a luxury hotel nearby that offers rooms at \u20ac320 per night, for example. You make a reservation and only have to pay \u20ac90 per night.

For the proof of sufficient financial means, it is to prove that you can financially cover your trip. For this, you usually need to present your last 3 pay slips and bank statements.<h3>How much to pay for a tourist visa?<\/h3>\nThe cost of the visa depends on the country. There are some countries for which <strong>the visa application is free,<\/strong> while others charge a processing fee. These fees also depend on the length of stay and the visa criteria you have chosen.<h3>How long will you have to wait for a response?<\/h3>\nThe time required to process your application also varies depending on the country. Generally, you must wait between 7 and 15 days to receive an answer to your request. We advise you to ask this question directly to the embassy or consulate to be sure. Preferably, <em>apply for your visa several weeks before the date of<\/em> your trip. It is also possible to <strong>apply for an emergency visa<\/strong> so that your application can be processed in a few days or even hours. However, this procedure will cost you considerably more than a normal visa application. On top of that, you will have to present a justification to explain the reason why you have applied for a visa in such a hurry."}}
