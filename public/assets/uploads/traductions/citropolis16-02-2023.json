The examination according to the new procedures takes into account, among other things, the pollutant emissions. Find out what is actually assessed during a roadworthiness test.<!--more--><h2>Technical inspection: definition?<\/h2>\nThe CT is a visual examination carried out by professionals (technical controller) in an approved center. It lasts 45 minutes on average and does not require any dismantling. The control is carried out with the aim of checking the conformity of the vehicle compared to the <strong>standards of setting in circulation<\/strong>. At the end of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.citropolis.fr\/tout-savoir-sur-le-controle-technique\/\">inspection<\/a>, the center will issue a <em>report<\/em> to the owner of the vehicle. This document specifies whether the vehicle is authorized to circulate or whether it is necessary to proceed to a counter-inspection (more details on the counter-inspection in the last paragraph). In addition, a sticker to be put on the windshield attests the conformity of the vehicle and indicates the date of the next technical control.

The professional in charge of the technical control ensures that these elements are in accordance with the specificities of the vehicle and the regulations in force. He also checks that no unauthorized modifications have been made.<h3>Braking equipment<\/h3>\nThe <a href=\"https:\/\/www.citropolis.fr\/sachez-evaluer-lefficacite-de-vos-freins\/\">braking system is checked<\/a> at 20 points including the brake pedal, brake pads, anti-lock system, brake distributor, etc. The examination consists of checking for excessive wear, fluid leaks, corrosion, deterioration of components and other potential failures that could affect the car's performance.<h3>Steering<\/h3>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/g2qm5rt0ce.citropolis.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/volant-direction-voiture-scaled.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-869 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/g2qm5rt0ce.citropolis.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/volant-direction-voiture-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"volant v\u00e9hicule\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" \/><\/a>\n\nThe steering system includes 13 technical control points. For example, the inspector checks the steering wheel attachment, the condition of the steering linkage and the electronic power steering system. The aim is to ensure that the steering components are fully functional so that the driver can keep control of the trajectory followed and the orientation of the car.<h3>Visibility<\/h3>\nThe windshield and any other glass present on the car, the mirrors (interior and exterior), the control system associated with the exterior mirror, the windshield wipers and washers are the 7 points evaluated during a technical inspection.\n\nThe stakes are high as these elements play a major role in the driver's visibility, which has an impact on his ability to anticipate obstacles and adopt the right reflexes on the road. caption id=\"attachment_870\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/g2qm5rt0ce.citropolis.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/retroviseur-scaled.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-870 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/g2qm5rt0ce.citropolis.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/retroviseur-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"retoviseur voiture visibilit\u00e9\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" \/><\/a> Mirrors are essential for good driver visibility[\/caption]<h3>The lighting of the car<\/h3>\nAll the lights and signal elements, as well as the associated warning lights, total 22 CT points. In addition to improving the driver's visibility, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.citropolis.fr\/voiture-que-risquez-vous-si-votre-eclairage-est-defectueux\/\">the vehicle's lighting<\/a> allows other road users to spot the driver, which limits the risk of accidents.

The wheels are obviously concerned, to which are added the axles and suspensions, the bearings and the trains... These are the organs that ensure the car's adherence. It is therefore important that they are not subject to any wear, deterioration and\/or abnormal deformation, but also that the fixings are correct.<h3>The mechanics<\/h3>\nThere are 13 points to check in the mechanical parts, including the engine, the drive train, the exhaust manifold, the gearbox and the transmission. Not surprisingly, these are the elements that ensure a large part of the car's performance. It is therefore essential that the mechanics be perfectly maintained and that they not be the cause of any possible failure.<h3>The bodywork<\/h3>\nIt is often mistakenly thought that the bodywork plays a purely aesthetic role, but this is not the case. It must be able to ensure the safety of the passengers, the mechanical parts and everything that the car contains\/carries. The inspector therefore checks 20 different points to evaluate the condition of the structure and bodywork. We can mention the floor, the hood, the wings, the bumper, the doors and the tailgate, the mudguard...<h3>The other equipment of the car<\/h3>\nThese are the equipments that ensure both your comfort and your safety, namely the seats and the safety belts, the battery, the hitching system, the support for the spare tire, the sound warning system and the airbag.

The inspector measures the CO2 content of the exhaust gases and compares them to the reference values defined by the manufacturer. The opacity of the exhaust smoke is also analyzed. In addition, the controller evaluates the noise emanating from the engine. Finally, it looks at the on-board diagnostic (OBD) system.<h2>What are the critical points requiring a second inspection?<\/h2>\nThe checks carried out allow us to identify any technical problems with the vehicle concerned. These failures are then classified into three categories:<ul>\n \t<li><u>minor defects:<\/u> the necessary repairs are specified by the inspector but no follow-up inspection is required;<\/li>\n \t<li><u>Major defects:<\/u> these problems can considerably affect the car's performance.

Critical defects: the problems identified threaten the safety of road users, for example, a cracked axle, corrosion of the braking system, the absence of more than one rear-view mirror, excessive deformation of the chassis, etc. The counter-inspection must be carried out within 24 hours.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nThe <a href=\"https:\/\/www.citropolis.fr\/zoom-sur-le-controle-technique-automobile\/\">technical controls of cars<\/a> are carried out according to a precise periodicity to ensure that the vehicle submitted to the control does not represent a threat either for the driver and his passengers or for the other users of the road.

This is a legal requirement, but you can still be as original as you like.<!--more--><h2>Reflective stickers on motorcycle helmets: what does the law say?<\/h2>\nAccording to article R431-1 of the French Highway Code, it is mandatory to wear a <strong>helmet<\/strong> approved by the ECE 22-05 standard. All motorized two-wheeler drivers are concerned. The presence of a reflective helmet sticker is included in the list of criteria set by the regulation which came into force in 1995. There are 4 stickers that must be firmly affixed so that they cannot be removed without damaging the helmet, whether it is a jet, full-face or modular helmet. These stickers must be affixed to the front (at the level of the forehead or chin), the back and both sides of the helmet. Specific dimensions must also be respected, i.e. a minimum of 20 mm in width for a rectangular sticker and at least 40 mm in diameter for a circle-shaped sticker. Each sticker must cover a minimum surface of 18 cm\u00b2. The obligation was put in place to facilitate the identification of <em>motorcyclists<\/em>, especially when they ride in low light conditions. This refers to the optimization of road safety.<h2>Where to find nice reflective stickers?<\/h2>\nThe regulations do not specify the choice of colors, which is left to the discretion of each individual. As long as you choose<strong> stickers<\/strong> that reflect white light and conform to the regulatory dimensions, you are free to choose the stickers you like. You can obviously turn to models with the effigy of the manufacturer of your motorcycle, but also skulls, the name of a singer, your favorite manga character and more.

To accomplish this task, you not only need to have the right equipment, but also follow a few rules. Here are some tips on how to effectively clean the exterior and interior of your car.<h2><!--more-->Cleaning your car: a daily necessity<\/h2>\nCleaning your car is a necessary step to keep it in good condition and to enjoy it as long as possible. Get your car back to the way it used to look by getting rid of stains on the seats or tar marks on the bumper, for example. For the exterior, clean the entire wheel assembly, paying special attention to items such as rims and hubcaps. Most often, the wheels are the dirtiest part of your car. That's why you need to put more effort into this area. The bodywork is also an aspect of your vehicle that should not be neglected in terms of maintenance. You will find products on the market that can give your car's sheet metal a shine. It is also essential to clean the interior of your car. The<strong>maintenance <\/strong>of this part of your vehicle consists of several phases. First, you should clean the door openings with a microfiber cloth. The washing of this area usually ends with the trunk, which is characterized by a rather dirty seal most of the time. Then think about dusting, cleaning the interior windows, floor mats and seats without forgetting to vacuum. This means vacuuming all the nooks and crannies of the vehicle, such as door stowage areas, seat rails, under seats, etc. For floor mats, don't hesitate to dry them thoroughly before putting them back in your car. Also, clean the plastics, the dashboard and many other parts of the windshield.<h2>The right material to clean your car<\/h2>\nTo keep your car clean and healthy, you need the right equipment. It is best to opt for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.distripro.net\/63-nettoyant-et-entretien-pour-voiture\">professional car cleaner<\/a>. It is important to have a variety of tools at your disposal such as a window squeegee, wipe, scrub brush, etc. There are several other products to take care of your vehicle, whether it's the exterior or the interior. Get a dashboard cleaner, a textile cleaner, a leather renovator to shine and protect your seats and many other <em>car<\/em> cleaners. An online purchase of the right car cleaning equipment is recommended. Specialized websites have the advantage of a large choice of products with a good quality-price ratio. From your office or home, you can place your order for car<a href=\"https:\/\/www.citropolis.fr\/entretien-voiture\/\">care<\/a> accessories and receive them as soon as possible. Both the interior and exterior of your car need to be regularly maintained to allow the <strong>driver <\/strong>and passengers to travel in better conditions. It is therefore essential to invest in the appropriate equipment to clean the body, the wheels and the interior of your vehicle."},"translate-10":{"url":"renovation-cars-old","title":"Renovation of an old car: I tell you everything","h1":"Renovating an old car: my experience","contenu":"I am the proud owner of a classic car. But between the purchase and the return to the road, I had to go through a company specialized in the restoration of <strong>old cars<\/strong>. <!--more-->It was a great adventure but from experience, I can assure you that it requires a meticulous preparation. I invite you to come back on this project that I was able to realize thanks to the know-how of a team of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.carrosserie-valdiserra.fr\/renovation\/\">industrial bodyworkers in Nice<\/a>.<h2>Antique car restoration: define my project well<\/h2>\nYou have to be aware that restoring <em>vintage <\/em>cars is a complex and costly operation. In addition to the purchase price, it is necessary to foresee the cost of the renovation which can reach tens of thousands of euros depending on the condition of the vehicle. Collectors know that the final bill often exceeds the initial estimates because various elements requiring restoration often appear as the restoration progresses. Moreover, it should be noted that not all renovations are always feasible. It is important to make sure that you can find compatible and, above all, high quality <a href=\"https:\/\/www.citropolis.fr\/ou-trouver-piece-automobile-vehicule\/\">car parts<\/a>, which is sometimes difficult or even impossible for models that were discontinued several years ago. Based on this information, you should determine whether you can devote time to a <strong>renovation<\/strong> that may take several months. At the same time, determine the maximum budget you can allocate to the project. This will allow you to define the maximum price for the purchase of the car, obviously taking into account possible budgetary contingencies.<h2>Find a specialist for the renovation of my old car<\/h2>\nYou might think that restoring beautiful vintage cars is within the reach of anyone who has some mechanical knowledge. I assure you that this is far from being the case. It takes a high level of expertise to understand the mechanics and electronics of these vehicles. If you don't, there is a risk of doing more damage than good, which is why I recommend that you hire a company that specializes in <strong>car restoration<\/strong>. The team will necessarily proceed to a complete diagnosis. This preliminary step aims to identify the elements that require repair or replacement. You will also need the assistance of specialists to understand the possible defects of the bodywork. Despite all the rigor and meticulousness deployed, I would like to remind you that the diagnosis does not always identify all the points to be improved. On the other hand, the fact of approaching a specialized company assures you that the estimates will be as precise as possible and that you will be regularly informed of the progress of your project if you decide to carry it out.<h2>Replacement and repair of damaged parts on my old car<\/h2>\nThe <em>technical inspection<\/em> is a must before a vehicle can be driven on the roads. For this, it is essential that all mechanical and electronic defects are properly corrected beforehand. The repair and replacement phase of the defective parts requires their <strong>disassembly<\/strong>, an extremely delicate process that requires the use of specific equipment. Add to this the fact that this stage requires a perfect understanding of old cars. Gestures must be precise and assured. The handling of the parts requires dexterity. Patience is also required because the work required for a specific part is often time consuming.<h2>The sanding technique to renovate my old car<\/h2>\nSandblasting is mainly used to strip the bodywork to bare metal. The technique can also be used on engine parts to remove traces of <em>corrosion and dirt<\/em> that affect the vehicle's performance. Professionals are the only ones who have the right equipment for quality sandblasting. In addition, special know-how is required to <strong>strip<\/strong> the surface without damaging it. The granulometry of the abrasive, the power at which it is projected... nothing must be left to chance.<h2>Renovate my old car with a new paint job<\/h2>\nOnce the <em>bodywork<\/em> is exposed, the body shop will check that there are no defects other than those initially detected. If necessary, repairs will be made before proceeding with the finishing touches. Painting is ideal to <strong>personalize<\/strong> the look of your vintage car. I personally like rarity, which is why I chose colors and patterns that look like me. If you have room in your budget, I also recommend renovating the interior. Have the pedals replaced, renovate the dashboard, choose new upholstery for the seats, the options are endless and the professional body shops will make suggestions that will enhance your car. The renovation took a long time. For budgetary reasons, I spent a little more than a year but it was worth it.

Here is a selection of jewelry for men to find the right accessory or accessories to adopt for a total biker look. So, between a ring, a signet ring or a nice solid silver jewel, which one will you choose? Follow the guide to find out which men's rings to choose for a real biker style!<!--more--><h2>A biker: but what is it?<\/h2>\nPassionate about motorcycles, a biker is a person who adopts a <strong>biker<\/strong> style. This American term shows the freedom that people who like to travel by motorcycle like. The term comes from the word \"bike\" in English, in reference to the motorcycle they like to use to get around. The biker also appreciates the taste of risk and the respect towards his peers. To be recognized as a true biker, he does not hesitate to mark his look. It is very often with a big leather jacket that he likes to dress. This <span style=\"color: #5c3ff3;\">leather jacket<\/span> with or without sleeves, sometimes with laces, allows him to be protected in case of <strong>motorcycle<\/strong> fall. And the accessories are not forgotten, including jewelry. These accessories mark a certain singularity and extend the posture and the clothing look of the biker. Here are different rings that bikers particularly appreciate to really adopt a unique style!<h2>Rings and rings<\/h2>\nThe biker can choose wedding rings and character rings as everyday jewelry. With its flashy look, the big silver ring quickly becomes part of a very assertive look. In a pure <strong>rock'n'roll<\/strong> spirit, the large Wall ring in oxidized silver knows how to make a difference. It can be worn on the middle finger, ring finger or thumb, with a finger size to be chosen between 60 and 64. If the wedding ring is the ring of commitment par excellence, the biker man likes to wear this jewel to assert his virility. The silver Turkish wedding ring, also known as the<em>\"puzzle<\/em>\" ring with 8 double bands, is also perfect for the male biker. It is available in different sizes, from 52 to 68, to suit a wide range of biker men. If you are tempted by one of these models of wedding rings or rings, you can buy them on the website of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mylittlefantaisie.com\/20-alliances-anneaux-homme\">My Little Fantasy<\/a>.<h2>Men's signet rings<\/h2>\nFor a total biker look, we love the American US Air Force signet ring in solid silver. This well marked <span style=\"color: #5c3ff3;\">signet ring<\/span> is a distinctive sign of the biker, it is almost emblematic even! The connoisseurs will appreciate this very singular signet ring that knows how to stand out. We can also advise bikers to select a King Lion signet ring in solid silver, with its black or turquoise Onyx to counter negative thoughts. This ring for men of assertive character shows a certain exuberance perfect for bikers. The black<strong>onyx<\/strong> or beautiful natural blue turquoise really highlights all the details of the signet ring, like the lion heads appearing on the sides of the jewelry.<h2>Anti-stress rings<\/h2>\nFor a ring that lets go and shows that biker form of freedom, the Dharma Stress Ring is well suited. This stress ring is made of solid silver. The braided ring is a motif symbolizing infinity and eternity for Tibetan <strong>Buddhists<\/strong>. This strong meaning reveals the power and strength of this much sought after anti-stress ring. The advantage of this biker ring is that it can be worn on the index, middle or thumb, depending on preference or previous rings. With even more character, the 6mm solid silver unchained stress ring has a braided pattern running lengthwise. What a pleasure it is to put on this biker-style statement ring, while protecting yourself from stress with its beautiful, soothing tribal braid pattern. You'll look great on your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.citropolis.fr\/quel-est-le-meilleur-choix-une-moto-ou-un-scooter\/\">motorcycle or scooter, whichever you choose<\/a>.<h2>Ethnic Rings<\/h2>\nMarking a work in detail, ethnic rings help men assert their personality. These rings are more or less imposing, bringing their point of <span style=\"color: #5c3ff3;\">delicacy<\/span> with very well worked features. The Watpo flared ethnic ring in silver plays the card of a certain originality with its depth effect. This fancy ring is a very beautiful quality jewel in <strong>silver<\/strong>. This man's ring can perfectly describe a biker look a little bohemian. This silver jewel is a singular and very enveloping ring. We love it!<h2>Thumb rings for men<\/h2>\nAnd the grail for a biker style is a silver jewel to wear on the thumb. When it comes to jewelry, this men's ring is a trendy accessory. This silver ring for men is easy to wear and very recognizable. This offbeat piece of jewelry for the strong heads can be the solid silver ZZ top rotating ring with its beautiful <em>zigzag <\/em>details or the <span style=\"color: #5c3ff3;\">two-tone silver<\/span> dizainier rotating ring, inspired by the famous dizainier rings. The <strong>thumb<\/strong> ring is every time a nice nugget to wear that we like to show and display. It pairs easily with other men's rings and is easy to choose. With the thumb ring for men, you are sure not to make any false notes, while asserting your look. The silver ring for men is a singular accessory of the biker. It is often chosen with a large size and full of character. The patterns of this costume jewelry for men do not usually go unnoticed. And if the signet ring for men is essential, the biker also adopts the thumb ring, the ethnic ring or the anti-stress ring."},"translate-12":{"url":"casque-integral-moto","title":"Full face motorcycle helmet: which one to choose?","h1":"How to choose a full face motorcycle helmet?","contenu":"<strong>Choosing a motorcycle helmet <\/strong>is by no means an easy thing to do.

This helmet is perfectly suited for everyday road use, as well as for possible competitions, for fun with friends. It has an internal screen that can be raised as well as a wide range of different screens depending on the model of the helmet.<h3>Full face city motorcycle helmet<\/h3>\n<strong>The full face city motorcycle helmet<\/strong> is a more comfort-oriented model. It is designed to be soundproof to always increase the comfort of the latter. In addition, it is possible to integrate communication devices inside the helmet.

However, motorcycle helmets with the 22.05 standard will no longer be allowed to be manufactured! Following this new ECE 22-06 standard, motorcycle helmets will be much safer. The latest generation of helmets will undergo several thorough tests in terms of impact resistance and others. It should be noted that with the ECE 22.05 standard, manufacturers, but also drivers, must honor certain rules, ie:<ul>\n \t<li>motorcycle helmets on sale must bear a white label with the letter E (Europe) ;<\/li>\n \t<li>a number specific to the country where the homologation has been affiliated must be displayed;<\/li>\n \t<li>the motorcycle helmet must also have 4 reflective stripes located in front, back, left and right side, the chinstrap must be properly fixed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nWith the new standard ECE 22-06 for motorcycle helmets, the principles are the same, the novelty of the standard of July 1 includes, as certified by<strong> Eric Thiollier<\/strong>, who is the president of the French Federation of Angry Motorcyclists:<ul>\n \t<li>3 tests and impact tests under several speeds with 18 points of impact and not 6 ;<\/li>\n \t<li>more thorough tests on the visor;<\/li>\n \t<li>the installation of a sensor to test its resistance to abrasion.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nWith this new standard and these new tests, the motorcycle helmet industry will have to manufacture helmets that are even safer, but also of high quality, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.citropolis.fr\/casques-moto-carbone\/\">carbon helmets<\/a> for example.

That said, to fully enjoy the feeling of freedom of a motorcycle, it is important to be well protected. The first thing you should never forget is the <strong>motorcycle helmet<\/strong>. It is so essential on the motorcycle that it is strictly forbidden to ride without it. On the market, you can find two types of motorcycle helmets:<ul>\n \t<li>full-face motorcycle helmet;<\/li>\n \t<li>Jet motorcycle helmet.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nThe difference between these two models lies in the design of the helmet, including its accessories. Speaking of<strong>motorcycle helmet accessories<\/strong>, here are those that are most useful during your rides:<h3>The anti-fog pinlock<\/h3>\nThe first essential accessory, especially during the summer season, is the pinlock. The pinlock is a kind of visor that you put over the screen of your helmet to prevent fogging. As we all know, the major disadvantage of motorcycle helmets in winter is fogging. This is very dangerous because it limits the driver's vision. Therefore, it is better to<strong> install a pinlock on the <\/strong>main<strong> visor <\/strong>.<h3>Muffler<\/h3>\nAnother essential accessory during the winter season is the nose cap. This accessory is very practical if you have a<strong> bowl type jet helmet<\/strong>. The muffler will then serve to cover your nose and protect it from the cold.<h3>The communication kit<\/h3>\nBefore talking about this accessory, let's remember that phone calls are forbidden on the motorcycle. However, it is perfectly legal to insert a communication kit in your helmet. The latter will allow you to answer calls without your hands leaving the handlebars. This way, you can stay focused on the road. Moreover, this communication kit allows you to talk with other bikers who are near you. How does it work? Just connect the two helmets. There are two types of<strong> motorcycle communication kits<\/strong>:<ul>\n \t<li>adaptable communication kit ;<\/li>\n \t<li>proprietary communication kit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Helmet carrying case<\/h3>\nIn order to carry your helmet safely, you can buy a<strong>motorcycle<\/strong><strong> helmet cover <\/strong>. This accessory not only allows you to store your helmet, but also to protect it from scratches or cracks. The motorcycle helmet carrying case is especially essential for delivery drivers because they frequently have to take off and put on their helmets.<h2>Which accessory to customize your motorcycle helmet?<\/h2>\nIf you want to get the most out of your motorcycle, you can customize your helmet. Indeed, since most helmets are made of carbon fiber, you can customize them in your own way. How can you do it? Well, there are several methods to <strong>customize motorcycle helmets<\/strong>. Among these are :<h3>Customize your motorcycle helmet with LED lights<\/h3>\nTo create a 3D rendering in the futuristic style, you can use LED lights to <strong>draw shapes on your helmet<\/strong>. Obviously, you can only admire the splendor of your helmet at night. But hey, it's worth a try.<h3>Screen printing<\/h3>\nIf you have an idea about a particular design that you want to reproduce on your helmet, you can opt for screen printing. However, before we start, we advise you to check with an advertising agency to see if it is possible to screen print your helmet, as there are certain <strong>models of motorcycle helmets<\/strong> that are incompatible with screen printing because of the material they are made of.<h2>Where to buy motorcycle accessories?<\/h2>\nMotorcycle accessories are not sold in all stores.

Also, if you have a matte helmet, then you have to be very careful because by rubbing hard, you risk removing all the varnish that is on the helmet. Also, once you are done soaping the outside of your motorcycle helmet, rinse it with warm water and dry it with another fiber cloth.<h3>Step 3: Clean the inside of the helmet<\/h3>\nThis is the most important part, especially don't forget the<strong>inside of the hel<\/strong>met. To do this, use a sponge soaked in soapy water and rub the entire interior surface. If you can't reach the corners, you can use a soft toothbrush. Once finished, rinse with warm water and let it air dry.

This program was launched to help motorcyclists make informed decisions when purchasing a safety helmet and to provide guidance on how to choose a helmet that fits properly and comfortably. The program also showcases approved helmets and the level of protection they provide using a simple 1-5 star helmet safety rating system. One star indicates a low rating but still meets minimum safety standards, while a 5-star rating indicates much better overall protection. To calculate the <strong>helmet safety ratings<\/strong>, each motorcycle helmet model is subjected to 32 three-speed impact tests.<h2>What is the penalty for not wearing a motorcycle helmet?<\/h2>\nMotorcyclists caught <strong>not wearing a <\/strong><strong>motorcycle helmet <\/strong>can receive an official warning or a fine of up to \u20ac700. Not only is <strong>riding a motorcycle without a helmet<\/strong> illegal, it is also extremely dangerous. A helmet reduces the risk of serious head and brain injuries by minimizing the impact of a force or collision on the head. If you are in an accident and not wearing a helmet, you are at greater risk of serious injury or death. According to the World Health Organization, head injuries resulting from motorcycle collisions are a leading cause of death and disability. For this reason, it is essential that motorcyclists wear a protective helmet.<h2>Types of Motorcycle Helmets<\/h2>\nThere are many different types of <strong>motorcycle helmets<\/strong>. It is important to buy one that offers a good level of safety, is comfortable and fits properly.

The more frequently you use something, the faster its rate of degradation. If you use your <strong>motorcycle helmet<\/strong> almost every day and subject it to harsh outdoor conditions, you can expect to have to replace it sooner rather than later. Conversely, a well-stored, seldom-used helmet will last longer. Other factors related to helmet use can accelerate deterioration.

They are also the helmets that are most resistant to aging and deterioration. The only downside is that they tend to be more expensive. Also consider whether it's a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.citropolis.fr\/casque-integral-ou-modulable\/\">full-face or flip-up helmet<\/a>. The quality of the helmet is measured using a variety of tests. The impact test evaluates the performance of the helmet against impact surfaces at specific accelerations. The positional stability test or roll test determines if the helmet can roll on your head.

Keep an eye on these signs to make sure your helmet is replaced periodically and your safety on the road is guaranteed.<h3>Helmet Age<\/h3>\nAs we mentioned at the beginning of this article, the age limit for <strong>motorcycle helmets <\/strong>is seven years after their date of manufacture. This period of time is guaranteed to weaken the shell and foam of your motorcycle helmet. Age has a huge impact on the quality of the helmet, and its age, coupled with regular use, is reason enough to replace it. Your helmet is exposed to aggressive agents such as:<ul>\n \t<li>ultraviolet rays;<\/li>\n \t<li>Sweat;<\/li>\n \t<li>Wind;<\/li>\n \t<li>Dirt.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nThey may not inflict obvious damage, but the cumulative effect will permanently weaken the resins and adhesives that hold your helmet in place.<h3>Exposure to accidents<\/h3>\nThis is common sense. If your <strong>motorcycle helmet <\/strong>has already been in an accident, it's time to replace it. Its internal mechanisms have been damaged by the impact. If there are obvious signs of cracks or fissures, it is safer to replace the helmet than to try to repair it with glue. Remember that cracks grow exponentially, so one small crack will lead to many more. A cracked helmet will not be able to withstand another accident, which defeats its original purpose.<h3>It is \"looser\".<\/h3>\n<strong>A motorcycle helmet <\/strong>needs to fit properly in order to be effective as protective gear. It should not be too tight, but not too loose either. The test is to shake your head from side to side, then see if it moves or stays in place. It should hang comfortably on your head and not move; if it moves too much, it will be more of a distraction than a way to protect your head.

Now we will see what is the difference between these two motorcycle helmets and which is the best.<h3>Full face motorcycle helmet<\/h3>\nThe full face helmet is a helmet that is <strong>fully enclosed,<\/strong> meaning that it covers not only the skull, but also the chin and forehead. Its <strong>level of protection is higher<\/strong> than that of the jet helmet. The full face helmet can be used on a sports track, in the city or on the highway. It is an ideal accessory for long trips at high speed. The full-face motorcycle helmet has a folding visor and vents. It is waterproof and can be worn from January to December. Its trim reduces engine noise. When closed, the full-face helmet offers the driver<strong> better aerodynamics<\/strong>.<h3>Advantages<\/h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>optimal protection of the face;<\/li>\n \t<li>protection against other inconveniences, such as cold, wind and insects;<\/li>\n \t<li>it is soundproof;<\/li>\n \t<li>it is aerodynamic.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Disadvantages<\/h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>the vision is reduced;<\/li>\n \t<li>we suffocate, because we have a feeling of confinement;<\/li>\n \t<li>it makes you sweat;<\/li>\n \t<li>the weight is rather high: between 1 200 and 1 600 gr.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nThis helmet, like all the others, must be approved, try it with your glasses the day of the purchase.

It is<strong> between the jet helmet and the full face helmet,<\/strong>because it is put on as quickly as a jet helmet and it closes very quickly, like the full face helmet. This helmet is called modular, because it<strong> has a removable chin strap<\/strong>. In addition, it has two positions:<ul>\n \t<li>the jet position ;<\/li>\n \t<li>the integral position.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nThe jet position has the chin bar up for city use, while the integral position has the chin bar and visor closed. This way, you can enjoy <strong>better protection and aerodynamics<\/strong>.<h3>Benefits<\/h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>comfort on the road ;<\/li>\n \t<li>comfort in urban environment;<\/li>\n \t<li>easy to put on.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Disadvantages<\/h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>it is heavy ;<\/li>\n \t<li>it requires a double homologation;<\/li>\n \t<li>It is expensive;<\/li>\n \t<li>It is bulky.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nThe purchase of a modular helmet requires J and P approval.<h2>Should I choose a full face helmet or a modular helmet?<\/h2>\nIf you are <strong>looking for safety, we advise you to buy a full face helmet<\/strong>. However, if you want to drive with optimal comfort and a minimum of safety, then a modular helmet will do the trick. Another important point: style and design. Depending on your needs, you can buy a full-face or modular helmet that looks good and suits your taste. In short, <strong>the full-face helmet is the best choice, <\/strong>since safety is the most important thing. The full face helmet is made in one piece, unlike the modular helmet, you will not have any risk, because in case of a fall, the latter will break and lose the visor and the chin strap. Nevertheless, if you prefer comfort,<strong> the modular helmet is a good choice<\/strong>.

This test is carried out in centers and by approved controllers.<!--more--><h2>Where can I get my car inspected in Nice?<\/h2>\nAny person, private individual or company is required to have a technical inspection of their vehicle. The technical control is carried out only in a technical control center approved by the French government. The cost of repairs can vary depending on the type of vehicle, light or heavy, but also from one department to another. However, before making an appointment for a car check-up, make a study of the different centers and decide what is best for you. At each check-up, the motorist provides the inspectors with a registration certificate, also known as the \"carte grise\". The inspector will indicate on the registration card the date the vehicle was put on the road and the number of points awarded during the inspection. If there are no defects, the inspector will affix a sticker on the vehicle's windscreen. This sticker specifies the month and year of the next visit. He also affixes a stamp on the registration card to indicate the condition of the car (favorable or unfavorable to a second inspection). The issuance of a sticker simply attests that the vehicle is in perfect condition from a general point of view, but that some minor repairs will not have a serious incident for the passengers on board as well as for the users. In Nice, we recommend the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nicecontroletechnique.fr\/\">Nice technical control<\/a> center for their professionalism and their efficiency!

Performing a technical inspection means, above all, being legally in order. In May 2018, the French government established new regulations for the organization and implementation of the technical inspection of automobiles, increasing the number of checkpoints from 124 to 132. During the technical inspection, a report is drawn up to list the status of the faults identified on the vehicle, and the owner also receives a copy of the report. The report specifies whether the vehicle is in good or bad condition. Unfavorable failures may be considered major or critical. All vehicles put on the road must have a favorable opinion. Critical failures can lead to a second inspection for repairs. If the inspection is delayed, the owner can be fined up to 750 euros and the vehicle can be immobilized. The general inspection of your vehicle is important. It becomes mandatory when the vehicle is older than 4 years. All vehicles, whether light or heavy, must be checked every two years at state-approved inspection points."}}
