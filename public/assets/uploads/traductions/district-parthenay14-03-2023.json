For a proper visit, I would first direct you to Piazza del Duomo which is right in the center of the Italian city. You can't go wrong with the place to visit, since you'll have plenty of time to let yourself be told that you've arrived at the Piazza del Duomo. There is an arch there that attracts a lot of tourists, and that vaguely reminds me of our own national arch. I wouldn't recommend venturing there on a weekend, as it's usually crowded. Another place in the city center that's well worth a visit is the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele, which is undoubtedly one of the largest shopping malls in the area. Granted, it's not really a tourist site per se. Nevertheless, the number of tourists who flock there is frightening. I even doubt that most of the locals are walking around when they feel that there are too many foreigners. For me, it was a good opportunity to discover great brands that we don't necessarily know in France. Notice to the shopping lovers who will surely find their happiness there. I also think that the place is good to find gifts. But to avoid if you are a compulsive buyer with a small budget. You're more likely to hurt your heart than anything else. Finally,<b><i> the center of Lombardy <\/i><\/b>also has the Sforza castle which is a little wonder to look at from all sides.

It's a no-frills town, but still worth its weight in peanuts for those who appreciate beautiful views. Besides the breathtaking panoramic view, the little village of Varenne has one of those old Rome architectures that make all the difference. For the record, this village, which looks like a paradise on earth, was destroyed more than once in medieval times. It should also be noted that Varenne is undoubtedly one of the places in Italy where the beauty of the churches has not lost any of its original aura. A place that smells good authenticity, and that gave me more than once the desire to not come back to France. Afterwards, I also discovered that this place had a whole panel of tales to its credit. Enough to spend peaceful moments in the evening, and even to arouse the curiosity of children. If you pass by Varenne, I think you might also be surprised by the warm welcome of the locals. Another good point for the region!<h2><b>Finish with Lake Iseo<\/b><\/h2>\nIf you need a moment of tranquility during your <b><i>stay in Lombardy<\/i><\/b>, I think a trip to Lake Iseo will do you good. You don't need to worry about relaxing there! The area is as green as you could hope for in a nature area, and the lake is enough to make you want to swim in the middle of nowhere. So, I'm not sure if it's allowed or even legal to dip even one foot in this lake! But that doesn't stop tourists from coming to enjoy the calm and the fresh air of the surroundings. On the program: a picnic, of course!

The capital of the country is Tehran and the official name given to the country is <strong>the Islamic Republic of Iran<\/strong>. The country covers an area of about 1,648,000 square kilometers with 81,224,870 inhabitants according to surveys in 2015. The local currency is the Iranian rial and the political regime in place happens to be a theocratic republic, since the year 2013 presided by Hassan Rohani.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               Persian is of course the official language of the country, but when you go there, you will see that many still use regional languages. <strong>The population of Iran is composed of many ethnicities<\/strong> in fact, they have been living together on the territory for quite some time. These include Persians, Baluchis, Kurds, Assyrians, Armenians and many others.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               As for the country's economy, the government has been trying for the last few years to take things in hand, but it is not yet won. They are trying to open up a little more to the world, but the past has a hard life, as <strong>the country<\/strong> has been <strong>strangled by the economic blockade<\/strong> for decades now. In addition, the country's livestock and agriculture are not sufficiently developed, especially since the population is constantly increasing.<\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Culture and art<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               I confess, I embarked on a trip to this country last year and I came back in one piece, but what's more, with this <strong>unprecedented feeling of having met a country<\/strong>, its people and its secrets too.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               As far as art is concerned in this country, it is especially architecture that has a great place, well for me anyway. <strong>The magnificence of these mosques<\/strong> that fill the cities will always amaze me. Pure structure, a very rich ornamentation, the domes covered with multicolored ceramics where the blue dominates most often.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               As far as literature is concerned, it <strong>is poetry that dominates<\/strong>. I was very surprised by the fact that Iranians devote such a cult to the classical poets who were ardent defenders of Persian culture, however, it must be admitted.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">              <strong>Painting and calligraphy<\/strong> are also part of Persian culture. As far as handicrafts are concerned, it is the carpet that perfectly represents that of Iran. The carpets are soft and often have different patterns depending on each city. Be careful, it is always handmade!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               As far as music is concerned, it is <strong>the traditional music<\/strong> that takes the lead in the whole city since music is normally forbidden. However, the Internet allows modern tunes to pass through, especially among young people. As for the cinema, it is not really appreciated in the country. In fact, Westerners are more familiar with the films of their homelands than the country's own inhabitants, probably because of this culture, this religion, let's say too puritan to be interested in modern things.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/d88jg5ns.district-parthenay.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/iran-voyage.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-400\" src=\"http:\/\/d88jg5ns.district-parthenay.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/iran-voyage-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"iran-voyage\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">What to eat in Iran?<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               In Iran, the food is good, it is very good. <strong>The local dishes are tasty<\/strong> and very fragrant, we must admit.

It's true that it's one of the rooms in the house where we spend the most time besides the bedroom. But what exactly is it for? Everyone has their own preferences and it's often difficult for busy people to find an effective living room arrangement.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               Watching TV, playing the console, entertaining people or playing the piano, you probably have some things you would really like to do so I recommend you <strong>make a list first<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               Depending on the space you have in your living room, you will have to <strong>make some choices<\/strong> though, because unless you have a huge living room, you won't be able to do everything you want in it. You probably won't be able to fit all the furniture in. So, of course, you have to stay within the realm of the possible.<\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Organize the furniture layout according to the activities<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               When you have finished choosing the activities you want to do in your living room, you will be able to work <strong>out a better organization of the living room<\/strong>, a better arrangement for the furniture as well. But it doesn't have to be like this.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I recommend you to take a paper and draw with a pencil the different corners to be installed in the living room. You should <strong>arrange each activity according to its importance<\/strong>. Put in place first the activity areas that present the most constraints, such as the TV corner for example, which takes up space and requires the installation of lighting and electrical sources. Take into account the presence of windows, which you cannot move to arrange the different activity areas. I advise you to put in place the areas that are easiest to classify, such as the entertaining area for example.<\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Choosing the right furniture for your living room<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               Once you have determined in which corner you want to put what, you need to move on to the next step, <strong>the choice of furniture<\/strong>. Today, there is a wide range of furniture models of all kinds on the market. It's such that it is sometimes difficult to make a wise choice.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               To choose well, I can only advise you to <strong>rely on your taste<\/strong>, your needs also, but especially the style you want to have in your living room. There are certain pieces of furniture that you can't do without in a living room however, like the sofa for example or the coffee table. After that, you should also choose according to the activities you want to do.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               To properly furnish the living room, you must be careful not to <strong>overload the room<\/strong>, otherwise you will feel too cramped. The best thing is to take just what you need to make the room as functional as possible and to make it fit what you want.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               If you have a small space, I advise you to <strong>think about clever furniture<\/strong>, like the TV table coupled with a bookcase for example or the small table in the corner that can also serve as a desk if needed. Remember, a successful decoration is not only a room full of furniture, but also a room with furniture in harmony with the style and colors you want to adopt.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/d88jg5ns.district-parthenay.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/decoration-salon-copie.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-396\" src=\"http:\/\/d88jg5ns.district-parthenay.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/decoration-salon-copie-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"decoration-salon-copie\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">And if you try a different style: the nomadic living room?<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               I have to tell you that since I am a real traveler, <strong>a nomadic living room<\/strong> seems to be the best possible option for my living room. Yes, a nomadic lounge is a lounge that aspires to travel, that transports you to a world in the tropics, among ethnic groups or deep in the jungle.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To achieve this type of decoration, it is essential to take into account various points. It is not a living room like the others, you are going to <strong>bring in a piece of country, a whole culture<\/strong>, so you must choose well.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For example, you can opt for a seat on the floor if you want to make think of Asia. Put <strong>an ethnic armchair in a corner<\/strong>, decorative objects coming from the 4 corners of the globe on your furniture, it's a total change of scenery without having to leave the living room.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For the colors, I advise you to <strong>choose bright colors<\/strong>, but also in warm tones like ochre for example, yellow or saffron. Once applied to the wall, you will see how it makes an effect, a lot of effect.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               In choosing your furniture, I recommend you to opt for the ethnic style, but you can also opt for<strong> custom furniture or wicker furniture<\/strong>. An African chair in a corner will make all its effect in the room, exotic wooden tables or a Chinese buffet, choose your furniture in order to create a good harmony.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               Another tip, I think it is not great to limit yourself to one country for example or one culture. The <strong>mixture of styles<\/strong> on the other hand can give you absolutely stunning results.<\/p>"},"translate-11":{"url":"learn-ski-with-me-today","title":"vide","h1":"Learn to ski with me today!","contenu":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It's starting to get colder and colder, and you know what makes me happy about that?

In the resorts, you must know that the slopes are not all the same, there are different levels of difficulty which are indicated with signs. An easy slope usually has a green sign, blue indicates an intermediate slope, red represents a difficult slope and black, a slope reserved exclusively for very good skiers. It is essential that you choose the slope that best suits your level of experience and knowledge.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               However, I would like to warn you that these signs can be misleading at times. Indeed, the difficulty of a slope can be different from one ski resort to another, a green slope in one resort can be blue in another. So, to be safe and to start well, I advise you to always <strong>start with an easy run<\/strong>. Afterwards, if you think that it is too easy for you, you can always change to a more difficult slope.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               Once you are on the trail, be aware that there is <strong>a priority rule<\/strong>. It is those who are downstream from you, those who are further down the trail, who have it. I advise you to avoid them as much as possible, you must also keep a good distance from the others, even more if you still have difficulty to control your skis.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               You must also learn to <strong>keep control of your descent<\/strong>, always stay in a place where everyone can see you to avoid accidents. Finally, if you start to feel tired, the best thing to do is to stop and take off your shoes for a hot chocolate.<\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Learn how to put on your skis<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               To start, I advise you not to buy your equipment but to rent it. I advise you to <strong>ask the store's employees to help<\/strong> you choose the skis. They must be the right size or you will have a lot of trouble putting them on. Also, ask them to make sure that they adjust the tightening.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               When resting, your feet should not feel compressed in the ski boots. You want to make sure that your toes don't rest against the boot when you bend your knees. <strong>The boot should also provide good support for your ankle<\/strong> to prevent you from hurting yourself.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">              <strong>How to walk with ski boots<\/strong>? The best plan is to walk briskly, but also to gently roll your foot from heel to toe while keeping your foot and calf straight as you move your body through, you'll find it easier.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               When you get your boots on, carry your poles and skis to the trail. I recommend that you <strong>put on gloves<\/strong> before you wear them, as the skis have sharp edges that can be sharpened, so you could get hurt.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               Finally got those pesky skis on? Great, now it's time to<strong>learn how to take them off <\/strong>. But how do you do it? I suggest that you simply press the lever behind the boot so that the boot is parallel to the ski. Use your pole by pushing the tip into the notch of the lever.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/d88jg5ns.district-parthenay.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/ski-monyagne.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-416\" src=\"http:\/\/d88jg5ns.district-parthenay.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/ski-monyagne-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"ski-monyagne\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">What are the basics of skiing that you need to know<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               I think you really need to sign up for ski lessons if you are new to skiing. In fact, it's always better to have experts with you to help you learn. <strong>Having a competent person<\/strong> with you is always safer for you, and you will learn faster.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">              <strong>Learning to walk with skis<\/strong> seems like a small thing when you talk about it, but I can assure you that many have already fallen by not giving it the attention it deserves.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               To <strong>move with the skis<\/strong>, you have to keep them parallel, then you have to push forward with your poles by planting them simultaneously and then pushing forward with your arms. I advise you to do the same thing when you need to walk.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               It is also important that you take the time to choose which technique is best for you. As a beginner, I think you should <strong>use the duck walk<\/strong> as well as the skate walk to avoid overtaxing your upper body.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               When you decide to hit the slopes, you should also think about <strong>adopting the basic ski position<\/strong>. I also advise you to spread the tips of your skis like a duck, to avoid sliding backwards. You also need to spread the back tips so you don't slide forward.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               I think you will also have to <strong>learn to stop when you are on the trail<\/strong>. To do this, I suggest that you point the tips of your skis towards each other. Then push your heels outward to form an open triangle at the back with the front facing downhill.<\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Choose a track at your level to practice<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               Since you are a beginner, you must <strong>choose the most appropriate track<\/strong> for you to ensure that you will practice safely. I would even advise you to first choose the children's slopes to practice safely. You have nothing to be ashamed of, you have to start somewhere, right?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once you are more advanced and know how to do more things, you will be able to <strong>take an easy track<\/strong>. The more confidence and knowledge you have, the more you'll be able to try the other trails.<\/p>"},"translate-12":{"url":"discover-norway-in-all-its-splendor","title":"vide","h1":"Discover Norway in all its splendor","contenu":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As you probably already know, I am a very curious person, I like to make beautiful discoveries and live interesting adventures.

A must-see for tourists, no doubt, but it is well worth it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               Oslo is also a reflection of the culture, art and history of the country. If there is one thing I can advise you to do, it is to take the ferry to go to <strong>the peninsula of Bygdoy<\/strong>. Once there, you will see the Norwegian Folk Art Museum as well as the Viking Ship Museum, fabulous discoveries to make. I can assure you that you will not lack entertainment once you are there.<\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some favorites I would like to share<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               Of course, I had some favorites in this beautiful country that is Norway. As you can imagine, I enjoyed a wonderful show when I witnessed the <strong>Northern Lights<\/strong>. Without wanting to seem too flowery, I must admit that it is one of the most beautiful phenomena that exists in the world I find. I think that you should not miss it for anything in the world once you are there although it is freezing at night.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               We also went to <strong>the Lofoten Islands<\/strong> and frankly, I absolutely advise you to go there during your trip if you can. These beautiful islands are located north of the Arctic Circle, off Bodo. I had a perfect stay there: mountains, white snow, the beauty of the fjords, it is a small paradise, calm and serenity, a real paradise where it is cold.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Jostedalsbreen park<\/strong> is also a place that I recommend you to visit once you are in Norway. The name is certainly a little difficult to pronounce, but once you are there, you will realize why I advise you to go there. It is without a doubt one of the most beautiful wonders of Scandinavia in terms of parks.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               As I also like outdoor sports, you can imagine that I didn't hesitate one second when I was told to go hiking. With 5 hours round trip, it was a very interesting experience and frankly, the show that was waiting for me at the arrival was worth it! Enjoy indeed <strong>the Lysefjord<\/strong> in all its splendor once arrived at the top of Preikestolen.  ,<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               If you particularly like snow and ice, I think that you will also appreciate a small all on <strong>the glacier of Briksdal<\/strong>, not to be missed during your trip in Norway. You will be able to appreciate a new show with snow, blue snow, in the natural of course.<\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Discover also the numerous magnificent fjords of the country<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               You must probably suspect that <strong>fjords<\/strong> are not what is missing in Norway. I asked myself the same question as you, what is a fjord in fact? No need to google, they are arms of the sea which advance in the earth to give a magnificent result. We can appreciate the sea without going to the coast and it's just great.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               There are some fjords that really caught my eye. I advise you to go to <strong>the fjord of dreams<\/strong>, and it is not for nothing that this place is called like that. Indeed, it is like a place straight out of a dream. It is a real little paradise on earth, as it is one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Norway, located halfway between Oslo and Bergen. The beauty of nature, the peace and quiet, everything for a dream stay.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               There is also <strong>the Geiranger Fjord<\/strong>, which is also a must-see on the spot. The latter is one of the most mythical fjords in Norway. The view is simply magnificent from the bridge of the Ferry. We could only stay one day in this place, but frankly, a whole month would not be too much.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               I also recommend you to <strong>visit Lysefjord<\/strong>, a perfect representation of the beauty of the Norwegian landscape. Let yourself be carried away by a cruise of 42 km to discover this magnificent place, you will not regret it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/d88jg5ns.district-parthenay.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/norvege-1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-411\" src=\"http:\/\/d88jg5ns.district-parthenay.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/norvege-1-300x201.jpg\" alt=\"norvege-1\" width=\"300\" height=\"201\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">When to leave to discover this magnificent country?<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               As in other countries, you should know that there is an ideal time of the year to <strong>discover Norway<\/strong>.

It is even more so in certain situations, such as illnesses. In fact, some illnesses require continued physical activity to keep the body healthy and in good shape. Another advantage of sport is to fight cellulite.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               It is for two reasons that I wrote this article today: so that we can talk about sport on cellulite, I know that it interests most of my readers. There is also the issue of sports and osteoarthritis. I know, these are two slightly different subjects, but they should also be discussed.<\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sports to fight cellulite<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               I'm not going to get into what <strong>cellulite<\/strong> is. I don't really know myself because in most cases, it is women who are affected by this problem, which doesn't actually hurt, but which is especially unpleasant to the eyes and to the aesthetic. It is these clusters of fat that form under the skin and that go up in addition, because they reach a significant rate of accumulation to say it simply.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               You should know that a sedentary lifestyle is without a doubt one of the most common causes of cellulite. Add to that a poor diet and you will soon have your thighs and hips invaded by this scourge that women hate so much.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">              <strong>Physical activity<\/strong> is the answer to the need to make cellulite disappear, but it is not enough. Indeed, sport allows you to build muscle and therefore limit the storage of fat in your body. In the same way, exercising also helps to stimulate circulation, thus preventing fat from settling, without mentioning the other benefits of exercising.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               Several methods must be combined to get rid of cellulite. For example, I recommend a good diet, massages and sports, as I have just mentioned the benefits of sports against cellulite. However, you have to be careful, not all sports are suitable for cellulite. I advise you to choose the most suitable sports to get rid of this excess of fat.<\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Which sport to successfully fight cellulite?<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               There are many sports that you can choose to practice in order to <strong>fight cellulite<\/strong>. But first, you should know that for general wellness, doing, 30 minutes of walking a day is recommended. You don't always have to go far to do it - the elevators, the commute to work or the subway station, walking the dog can be enough to do it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               I also advise you to practice a regular sport if you can of course. Endurance sports are the most recommended if you want to get rid of the cellulite you have on your body. Indeed, the efforts you have to make to ensure endurance work require your body to draw on all the energy reserves of the body, especially in the lipid reserves, the fats to hold the necessary performance.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/d88jg5ns.district-parthenay.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/orange-213548_1280.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-433 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/d88jg5ns.district-parthenay.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/orange-213548_1280-300x197.jpg\" alt=\"orange-213548_1280\" width=\"300\" height=\"197\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               I also advise you to think about <strong>weight training to successfully fight cellulite<\/strong>. Indeed, weight training allows you to build muscles, which helps to limit the formation of fat, mobilizing your body's resources for the construction of muscle tissue and the efforts made during the various exercises.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               Aquagym is also an interesting solution to help you fight cellulite. Lightened by water, the weight of the body becomes less important, thus allowing you to make more sustained efforts, without really realizing it since you are in water. This allows you to make significant efforts and expend energy. In addition, water helps shape your figure as cellulite disappears.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               I also recommend that you <strong>do fitness<\/strong>, especially since in these cases, you will be supervised by a coach and will also have to follow a special program to get rid of your cellulite. Don't worry, you will be able to regain your youthful figure very soon.<\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Osteoarthritis, exercising is necessary<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               There are many remedies found and recommended today for the treatment of osteoarthritis. However, you should know that it is just as essential to practice sports to keep yourself healthy despite the pain that this disease can cause.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               Many people think that staying inactive will make things easier, will make the pain less present, but this is a misconception that we all have. On the contrary, it is regular activity that can help you <strong>fight the effects of osteoarthritis<\/strong> on your body.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/d88jg5ns.district-parthenay.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/knee-1406964_1280.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-434 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/d88jg5ns.district-parthenay.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/knee-1406964_1280-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"knee-1406964_1280\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               It will help you strengthen your body's muscles and better protect your joints, and it will help maintain your overall health and body, especially your vascular system. Physical activity will also allow you to maintain the range of motion and flexibility of the joints that have been affected by the disease, as well as stimulate cartilage repair.<\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">What kind of sport should I do in this case?<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I know that it is not easy to take up sports in these conditions, since your joints are hurting. However, keep in mind that you will only benefit if you <strong>practice some physical activity<\/strong>, without forcing yourself too much though.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               There are programs designed for people with osteoarthritis, so ask your doctor for advice before you start. He or she may have special instructions for you. There are a few things you can do, however, that are valid in all cases, such as taking a 30-minute walk every day. It is also necessary to practice a sport activity progressively in terms of difficulty and duration.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               Stretching is also recommended to keep your joints flexible. Strengthening exercises are also a good idea to ensure the protection of your joints as best as possible.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               When it comes to <strong>practicing a particular sport<\/strong>, I advise you to choose sports that are non-violent and that do not attack the body and the joints too much. For example, you can go cycling or swimming if you like to stay in the water.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you like outdoor sports, you can also go walking and hiking. There are also gentle sports such as yoga and Tai Chi that allow you to stay active without stressing your body.  Finally, there are also gentle gymnastics that you can adopt to keep you in top shape.<\/p>"},"translate-14":{"url":"japan-the-destination-at-least-once-in-your-life","title":"vide","h1":"Japan, the destination to see at least once in your life","contenu":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As you know, I have traveled a lot, I love it anyway, like so many others.

Of course, I didn't have the opportunity to go back there after my first trip, but I will surely do it. The land of the rising sun is waiting for you, so hurry up and plan a trip to Japan. I assure you that it is a very interesting destination.<\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some places you should not miss<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               The first place I recommend you to visit once in Japan is without a doubt the <strong>Tokyo Imperial Palace<\/strong>. I know that the place is not open to the public during the whole year, but it's still worth going there. However, you should know that the palace is open to the public twice a year, so I hope you can go there then.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since you are already in Tokyo, I also recommend you to go and see the Tokyo Tower. I know, it looks like the Eiffel Tower, but it's not the case though. It is different because of its red color and the few extra centimeters that separate the two. The best is to go to meet it when it lights up in the evening!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/d88jg5ns.district-parthenay.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/travel-1598143_1280.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-428 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/d88jg5ns.district-parthenay.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/travel-1598143_1280-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"travel-1598143_1280\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I also advise you to go to the Bamboo forest of Arashiyama. We think that it is a simple forest with bamboo, but bamboo, we don't find any at home to begin with, and then it is one of the most quiet place I have ever been in my life. I also advise you to go and see <strong>the city of Kamakura<\/strong>, it is rich of different historical monuments, including the most seated Buddha in the world.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               How we are in the land of the rising sun, I could not help but want to attend this show from this beautiful place.  What I recommend you to do is to walk and climb Mount Fuji, the highest mountain in Japan, to witness a beautiful sunrise like you only see once in a lifetime. Don't worry, the climb is accessible to everyone.<\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Visit the aquariums to get acquainted with the marine fauna<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               I also advise you to take the time to visit the many aquariums that Japan has. What I can say is that the country is rich in marine fauna. You have many species that you will not see elsewhere in these aquariums. As I am not a big fan of diving, I must admit that it is a good way to get acquainted.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               So I advise you to go to the Osaka aquarium if you are in the area, the beautiful castle is also a great place. You should know that this aquarium is the third largest aquarium in the world. You can find hundreds of species of animals there, interesting discoveries to make to enrich you during your trip.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               You should also check out <strong>the Roppongi Hills Sky Aquarium<\/strong> in Tokyo. I am sure that during your trip, you will pass by there, it is also the time to enjoy a beautiful and interesting show on the place. But be careful, it is not one of those big aquariums, it is small with a lot of charm and animals.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               Enoshima Aquarium is one of the most impressive aquariums you will see in Japan. You will indeed be able to admire various interesting specimens in the cave of the aquarium. Sometimes you feel like you are being swallowed by the sea, but it is so amazing that you forget your fears.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               Marine World Aquarium, in Kinosaki is also an aquarium not to be missed during a trip to Japan. Fish and dolphins are waiting for you in this beautiful place. You will also be able to appreciate the famous puffer fish in the Shimonoseki Aquarium, very interesting specimens, so I advise you to go there.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               Last but not least, it would be nice to go to <strong>the Churaumi Aquarium<\/strong> to see sharks, rays, jellyfish and other underwater animals. This is also one of the aquariums that you should not miss.<\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Castles not to be missed in Japan<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               If you pass by Osaka, the Osaka castle, the <strong>historical symbol of the city<\/strong> is a must-see monument in this city. What I liked most about this place is the contrast that the beauty and majesty of this ancient palace makes with the rest of the city. An image that I will probably never forget in my life. Indeed, its traditional beauty as well as its fabulous architecture have been preserved even if in the meantime, the city has been put to the tunes of time.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               I also recommend you to go and see the Hiroshima Castle, a must see during your trip. Moreover, the city of Hiroshima is a must-see when you visit Japan. Its history is still remembered and the place has not changed much since then. Don't worry, it is safe to go there nowadays. The castle was rebuilt after this tragedy, it is smaller, but still almost identical to the old one.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               You should also <strong>visit Himeji Castle<\/strong>, one of the few castles that has not been rebuilt since its creation. This is probably one of the reasons why I like this place particularly. Time has preserved it well in any case.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finally, you will also go to Matsumoto Castle which is the oldest wooden castle in Japan. It is a real national treasure for Japan and when you look at it closely, you can understand why. So don't hesitate to go there.<\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pagodas, which seem lost in time<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">               What I appreciate most in Japan is the architecture of their houses, palaces and shrines that they have in number too. I recommend you not to miss the numerous pagodas that there are in Japan. I recommend you to go and see the Yakushiji Temple, especially when the trees are in bloom, it is simply beautiful, do not forget your camera.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Itsukushima Shrine<\/strong> is also one of the pagodas I recommend you to see, especially if you are looking for peace and quiet. It is located on an island almost facing Hiroshima. So you can enjoy the place and the serenity it inspires as much as possible.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/d88jg5ns.district-parthenay.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/natural-1225186_1280.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-427 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/d88jg5ns.district-parthenay.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/natural-1225186_1280-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"natural-1225186_1280\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I also recommend you to go to Toshoguo temple. You will find it in Ueno Park, and you will be able to enjoy a moment of calm and tranquility while discovering this castle.

Not easy indeed to put in the same room, dining room, living room and bedroom. Today, I come to speak to you about a product, a piece of furniture that will allow you to decorate, to furnish correctly the interior of your small studio without feeling cramped: <strong>the BZ bench<\/strong>!<\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">What is a bench BZ?<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You are probably wondering what a BZ bench is, right? I know, it's not a very common name and personally, I had never heard of it before a while ago. It sounds like a super beautiful super interesting new thing when you put it that way, but it's actually a pretty old concept that has been revisited anyway!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We've known for decades about the folding beds we like to have in our house, the kind of click-bed we pull out when we have guests and want them to have a good night's sleep even if we don't necessarily have a guest room with a great bed to accommodate them. Today, it is a little in the same concept that is presented to us the bench BZ, we also call it accordion for information.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In fact the bench BZ is simply a sofa bed, but be careful anyway! We are not talking about a sofa bed like the others. As I just told you, clear improvements have been made to this piece of furniture to make it even more practical and even more comfortable than all the sofa beds you have ever met in your life.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">During the day, the BZ sofa is just like any other sofa. All you have to do is fold it up and arrange it so that no one suspects that it's your bed, of course. Don't forget your panties in it by the way, it could be very embarrassing if someone ever finds them! In any case, I think it is an ideal piece of furniture that you can install in your studio to allow you to welcome your guests.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> With armrests and cushions to make it pretty, I recommend you don't use them as pillows, you'll have a very nice and <strong>comfortable sofa<\/strong> to sit on or have your friends sit on. A great choice for a small space, I think you'll agree, right?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once the day is over and it's time to go to bed, you just have to unfold your sofa to turn it into a comfortable bed. In fact, the BZ sofa has been designed to be more comfortable than any other sofa bed you've ever known in your life. The exquisite feeling of being in a good bed after a hard day's work, there is nothing better, I assure you.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moreover, if it is not in a studio in which you live, you will be able without any concern to install the BZ bench in a place like your office for example, where sometimes, you can need a small nap, but where you also have to remain working late in the night. It will be of great use to you I am quite sure!<\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">A BZ : practical and comfortable<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What makes me suggest today to take a BZ bench in your small studio or simply in your office or even in the children's room to make an additional bed for when friends come to have a sleepover? Of course, it is for the comfort and convenience that this kind of furniture can bring in your life.<\/p>\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_440\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"475\"]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.magnan-meubles.fr\/\"><img class=\"wp-image-440\" src=\"http:\/\/d88jg5ns.district-parthenay.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/home-1822423_1280-300x214.jpg\" alt=\"home-1822423_1280\" width=\"475\" height=\"339\" \/><\/a> We associate comfort and practicality with the BZ![\/caption]<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Indeed, on the practicality side, I must admit that the BZ bench is simply the must for me in terms of <strong>sofa bed<\/strong> or sofa bed as we say so often. Indeed, the BZ sofa is one of these convertible sofas that allow you to use them without worry and to use them whenever you want or need.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The BZ sofa unfolds like an accordion. It is made of three articulated parts that allow you to unfold it without worrying about the bed. It is the same thing to put it back in the shape of sofa, you just have to fold it simply, as you would do it with an accordion.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In most cases, it makes a <strong>two-seater sofa<\/strong>, so I would advise you to turn it into a two-seater bed as well. You never know what excess weight can cause with furniture like this, so it's best to respect what you may have been told about it, right?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Equipped with a cover, which you can choose the color of course, this one can turn into a soft blanket to keep you warm at night.

I had an enriching experience on many sides, despite some disappointments. After living in the New Caledonian capital for 2 years, I decided to share with you my impressions of my <strong>stay in Noum\u00e9a<\/strong>. By the way, if you have already booked your <strong>plane tickets<\/strong> and your luggage is ready for the <strong>trip<\/strong>, go read my article on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.district-parthenay.fr\/nos-secrets-pour-voyager-en-toute-serenite\/\">how to travel safely<\/a>!<!--more-->\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-600\" src=\"http:\/\/d88jg5ns.district-parthenay.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/noumea.jpg\" alt=\"noumea\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" \/><h2>What I liked in Noumea<\/h2>\n<h3>1. The beauty of the place<\/h3>\nNoumea is the main city of the southern province of New Caledonia. It is located on <strong>Grande Terre<\/strong>, an island situated in the heart of a large lagoon bordered by a coral reef. Its superb landscapes reveal a fauna and flora still well preserved. The city preserves nearly 230ha of <em>mangrove<\/em> near the coastline which still has some mangrove trees several hundred years old. Its 120km of coastline is dotted with beautiful sandy beaches inviting you to relax, with the small islands of the New Caledonian archipelago in the background. A short boat ride will take you to <strong>Pine Island<\/strong>, one of the archipelago's unspoiled territories. During the egg-laying season, it is also possible to go to <em>Turtle Bay<\/em>, a few hundred kilometers from Noumea, to observe these majestic marine animals.<h3><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-601\" src=\"http:\/\/d88jg5ns.district-parthenay.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/flore.jpg\" alt=\"flore\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" \/>\n2. A less stressful life than in mainland France<\/h3>\nThe pace of life in Noumea is much more relaxed. Because of the warm tropical climate in the South Pacific, there is always an air of vacation. Here, people live mainly in the morning to adapt to the weather. Moreover, school starts earlier than in mainland France. Classes start around 8am and end around 3:30pm, with a short break between 11:15am and 1pm. In the late afternoon, it is not uncommon to see water sports enthusiasts at the beach. The atmosphere in Noumea is also more friendly. Natives and tourists mingle on the Place des Cocotiers. The locals are open. It is easy to make new friends. Caledonians are used to being on familiar terms.<h3>3. A society full of diversity<\/h3>\nMulticulturalism is omnipresent in Noum\u00e9a. The different influences can be seen in the city's architecture as well as in its cuisine. Upscale residential areas rub shoulders with the huts. Indeed, many Kanaks still live in traditional houses. In the center of Noum\u00e9a, one can still find buildings dating from the colonization period. The population of Noum\u00e9a has several origins. A large majority is European. They are metropolitans and <strong>Caldoches<\/strong>, expatriates who have lived on the island for several generations and descendants of former colonists. The <strong>Kanak<\/strong> population, the indigenous tribe, represents a significant part of the population. In addition, there are Asian and Oceanian communities. Many Melanesians come from other French overseas territories such as Wallis and Futuna or Tahiti. The cultural diversity of the city is also reflected in its leisure activities. During my stay, I had the opportunity to visit many museums and art galleries, and to go to the movies.<h2><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-602\" src=\"http:\/\/d88jg5ns.district-parthenay.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/cocotier.jpg\" alt=\"cocotier\" width=\"640\" height=\"960\" \/>\nLiving in Noum\u00e9a : what I didn't like<\/h2>\n<h3>1. A delicate political situation<\/h3>\nDuring my stay in Noum\u00e9a, I was able to realize the political tension that reigns in the archipelago. The tragic events of 1988, which took place at the <strong>Ouv\u00e9a cave<\/strong>, are still very present in people's minds. In the aftermath of colonization, the pro-independence movement opposed the loyalists on the issue of <strong>New Caledonia<\/strong>'s independence. It claims the total autonomy of New Caledonia vis-\u00e0-vis the French Republic. In accordance with the provisions of the Noum\u00e9a Accord, the indigenous people put the situation to a vote. The two referendums held respectively in 1987 and 2018 had an identical outcome: the rejection of independence. The uncertain situation in Caledonia is leading to a feeling of insecurity in some regions.<h3>2. A relatively expensive life<\/h3>\nAs far as currency is concerned, 1 euro is equivalent to about 120 <strong>Pacific francs<\/strong>. Overall, life is significantly more expensive in the New Caledonian capital compared to the rest of the island and to Metropolitan France. This is mainly due to the monopoly found in several sectors of activity. You will find many imported products in the shops. The high taxes applied increase the selling price considerably. The increase in the expatriate population in Noum\u00e9a has an impact on the real estate market. The supply of rental housing is insufficient to meet the growing demand. Rents are sometimes more expensive than in mainland France. Charges weigh quite heavily on the budget. Water and electricity bills, telephone and internet subscriptions, and living expenses add up quickly. The influx of tourists throughout the year affects the price of entertainment. On average, it costs 10\u20ac for a movie ticket and the bill is quite high at restaurants.<h3><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-603\" src=\"http:\/\/d88jg5ns.district-parthenay.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/nouvelle-caledonie.jpg\" alt=\"nouvelle caledonie\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" \/>\n3. Distance from my family and friends<\/h3>\nAs Noum\u00e9a has modern infrastructures, it is easy to forget that New Caledonia is almost 17,000km away from Metropolitan France. Inviting your relatives to visit you or to spend a few days in France was complicated during my stay in Noumea. If having a valid French passport is enough to travel between France and this overseas territory, the trip is particularly long. You have to plan at least 25 hours of flight time. The routes include one to three stopovers depending on the itinerary chosen. Flights usually stop in Japan or Australia before arriving at the destination. Moreover, the ticket is relatively expensive. It is recommended to prepare the trip at least 6 months in advance to find the best deals. It is also 9 hours longer in Noumea than in France. The time difference makes telephone or internet communication difficult. Calls must be well scheduled to fit everyone's availability. Moving to Noumea allowed me to change my pace of life while enjoying an idyllic setting marked by turquoise lagoons and beaches. Despite the high cost of living and the tension due to the instability of the political situation on the island, the city remains a great place to live."},"translate-28":{"url":"what-you-need-to-know-before-you-apply-for-canada","title":"Important points for applying for an EV","h1":"What you need to know before applying for an AEO for Canada","contenu":"Ottawa, Toronto, Montreal or Vancouver, many Canadian cities are increasingly popular with <em>travelers<\/em>.

Indeed, the first essential reflex is to apply for an AVE! You will find in this article all the necessary information to prepare your trip to the \"Great White North\".<h2>AVE application: what is it?<\/h2>\nDifferent from the traditional <strong>visa<\/strong>, the AVE, meaning \"electronic travel authorization\", is a mandatory and indispensable document to enter the Canadian territory. Whether you are in transit in an airport or determined to explore this fabulous country for several months, you will naturally be asked by an immigration officer to present this document. Don't panic, in the overwhelming majority of cases, everything will go smoothly and you will be allowed to stay in the country. Valid for five years from the date of issue, the AVE Canada can be obtained very easily online. It is generally recommended to make this request on the official website of Canada, in order to benefit from a complete security, as well as clear and precise explanations. Indeed, it is even possible to find a PDF file on the website in order to guide you step by step through all the steps of the process. You will then have to fill out a form, as well as pay a processing fee of 7$ CAN (a little less than 5 \u20ac).

This may be a minor hiccup, but it will end favorably if the process is carried out in accordance with the established rules.<h2>What is the deadline for applying?<\/h2>\nOne of the advantages of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.canadatrip.fr\/site-officiel-ave-canada\/\">official AVE Canada application<\/a> is that it can be obtained at any time! Whether you have been planning your trip for several months or decide to leave on a whim, it is possible to obtain this document in just a few minutes. However, it is advisable to apply for it before buying your plane tickets, in order to avoid any unpleasant surprises. This is a logical clarification, but it is useful to remember it for people who tend to do things in the wrong order. In order to plan ahead, allow a week (maximum), in case additional documents are required, before you finally book your plane tickets.<h2>Points not to neglect<\/h2>\nAlthough the<strong>AVE Canada<\/strong> is easy to obtain, there are a few things to keep in mind, as with any administrative formality of this kind. First of all, you have to pay attention to the information you provide in the form (name, first name, passport number, etc.). Then, when you receive your confirmation e-mail, you must check that the information on the AVE is correct (no typing errors in the name, identical passport number, etc).\n\nAlso, before applying for your AVE online, always make sure to check the validity date of your passport...

In particular, you have the social security, the mutual insurance company of the deceased and his insurance company (life or death) if he has subscribed. In addition, it is possible to deduct from the savings or account of the deceased.

This is one of the first choices to make. Then, <strong>the material<\/strong> also has its importance, whether it is silver, gold, steel or other fancy, your jewelry must be adapted to the person who will wear it, for a better visual but also according to the type of skin and its age. For a child, especially babies, it is better to offer gold jewelry because other metals may not be suitable for a more fragile skin. But don't worry, the jewelry store will offer a selection of jewelry adapted to your needs. The occasion for which the jewelry will be used already gives a good indication. Wedding rings are obvious, as are bracelets and chains for a christening.

You will then have to choose among all the different shapes, sizes and colors to finally find those fashion accessories that can make the difference.<h2>The ring: a timeless classic<\/h2>\nSince the time of the pharaohs, the ring is a jewel that is widely used and the custom of offering it during an engagement dates back to Roman antiquity. Nowadays, the most classic are those with a diamond, but there are rings for all tastes, all fingers and even all phalanges. For example, the fancy silver zigzag ring can be worn on the fingertip or on the thumb. For those who prefer stacked rings, a marquise like the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mylittlefantaisie.com\/bagues-empierrees-pour-femme\/1754-bague-navina-ovale-en-quartz-rose-et-argent.html\">Navina oval rose quartz and silver<\/a> ring is a great option. Also very popular with men, the ring is a good way to stand out or to mark one's membership in a clan or brotherhood for example. More than a simple piece of jewelry, it can also be an <strong>anti-stress<\/strong> ring like the Dharma anti-stress ring in solid silver whose central rotating ring will give you style and relaxation. For children, there are also a variety of choices, although more discreet toe rings are more common.<h2>The bracelet: aesthetic and whimsical<\/h2>\n[caption id=\"attachment_844\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/d88jg5ns.district-parthenay.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/br-papillons.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-844 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/d88jg5ns.district-parthenay.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/br-papillons.jpg\" alt=\"Parmi les bijoux populaires, les bracelets sont tr\u00e8s esth\u00e9tiques.\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" \/><\/a> Among popular jewelry, bracelets are very aesthetic[\/caption] Used since prehistoric times for protection or religious rituals, the bracelet is now one of the must-have fashion accessories. The classic bracelet is made of chain links surrounding the wrist with sometimes medallions or other accessories attached to the links. One variation is the <strong>bracelet<\/strong> which is generally flatter with a plate where the first name or initials are engraved. Another type of bracelet is the shamballa, originally made of wooden beads in the Tibetan Buddhist culture, we now find some with crystal beads, diamond beads, or agate balls like this shamballa bracelet in black agate balls. According to tradition, the <strong>color of the beads<\/strong> has a meaning like relaxation for the blue, harmony for the green or prestige for the black. Another essential and very elegant, <strong>the ring<\/strong> is a rigid ring open or closed that allows to have class while keeping its simplicity. Finally, the cuff is wider, generally rigid and open for a more marked style. Appeared in the 30s, it still keeps its success to captivate the eyes during an evening. The bracelet Liliana openwork wide cuff sandblasted is the perfect example.<h2>The necklace: elegant and <span style=\"color: #203748;\">surprising<\/span><\/h2>\nThe origin of necklaces also goes back to prehistory, allowing to expose to the world the wealth of the one who wears it. Golden, silver, flowers, choker, necklace or pendant, there is something for everyone. It can also be a fetish accessory or a <span style=\"color: #203748;\">lucky charm<\/span> as for surfers for whom the necklace connects them with the sea. On the other hand, the pearl or rhinestone necklaces are a great classic that will give you a great elegance. This is the case of the Mala Tibetan mango wood bead necklace with small wooden beads for a more spiritual style while remaining very fashionable. A discreet choker necklace can also make a difference while allowing you to wear your medallion or amulet on you. On the other hand, <strong>the necklace<\/strong> is also a very effective accessory to attract the eye, ideal when you have shapes to highlight.<h2>The earrings: seductive and unmissable<\/h2>\nMore than for aesthetics, earrings can be considered as <strong>a protective talisman or a sign of belonging<\/strong>. It was even said that it could improve the sight and chase away the moods.

Every moment on a karting track is a source of a pleasant adrenaline rush, but I am aware that there are certain risks. That's why I choose my protections very carefully.<!--more--><h2>For my safety, I always have a kart helmet<\/h2>\n[caption id=\"attachment_850\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1200\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/d88jg5ns.district-parthenay.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/equipement-karting.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-850 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/d88jg5ns.district-parthenay.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/equipement-karting.jpg\" alt=\"L'\u00e9quipement type pour pratiquer du karting est n\u00e9cessaire !\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" \/><\/a> The typical equipment for karting is necessary![\/caption] <strong>Karting<\/strong> is driving an open vehicle. In other words, I am exposed to possible projectiles, but also to shocks. Helmets were invented to protect motorsport enthusiasts like me. I always wear a full-face helmet that I bought from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.grandprixracewear.fr\/fr\/\">grandprixracewear.com<\/a>. To choose your helmet, I advise you to check the basic criteria such as the size of the helmet, the material it is made of and the size and color of the visor. It is extremely important that you feel comfortable and that you have a very good visibility on the <strong>karting<\/strong> track. The helmets are available in different designs. So you can match it with your other protections.<h2>To be more preventive, I bought a karting protection<\/h2>\nYou're probably thinking of the <strong>driver's<\/strong> suit and gloves but I'm not there yet. It's more about the accessories that reinforce my protection. In particular, I usually wear a neck and rib protector, which I complement with knee and elbow pads. When I plan to go karting on a hot day, I also put on a cooling vest, always with the aim of staying perfectly comfortable. With such protection, I can enjoy the thrill with peace of mind.<h2>I have a karting suit that combines protection and style!<\/h2>\nKarting suits are essential for karting as they are specifically designed to protect the driver in case of a <strong>crash<\/strong>. The material used is perfectly resistant to abrasion. The cut can be ergonomic to optimize freedom of movement. I chose a light and breathable driver suit for leisure. In racing competition, I prefer thicker racing suits but they are still very comfortable to wear. As for the design, it depends on my inspiration of the moment, except in competition: I always wear a <strong>suit<\/strong> with the colors of my sponsors. I always opt for a homologous model.<h2>I never forget my karting boots to protect my feet<\/h2>\nDriving karts requires good sensitivity in the feet. Otherwise, you can't handle the pressure on the pedals effectively. Karting boots are specially made with this requirement in mind. The grip is excellent and I can feel my <strong>pedals<\/strong> very well, which allows me to adjust my speed in turns, but not only that. The high cut is an asset: in addition to the feet, the ankles are well protected. The quality of support is also appreciable.<h2>My karting gloves offer me comfort and grip<\/h2>\nYou will agree that it is not easy to drive with sweaty or wet hands because of the weather. So racing <strong>gloves<\/strong> are a welcome addition to my kit as they give me a very good grip. The gloves also protect me from excess heat, cold and rain, but that's not to mention the most important thing: my hands are safe in case of a fall or an impact because they are not directly exposed. As a good motorsport enthusiast, I only trust the best brands, available at low prices in specialized stores.<h2>To ensure the proper functioning of the kart, I have a kart lubricant.<\/h2>\nGo-karts are like cars: they need to be pampered to function properly. They are not very demanding, but the use of a lubricant from time to time is highly recommended to keep the engine in perfect condition. The mechanical parts are protected against premature wear and all the gears work perfectly. I stay calm on the straight lines as well as in the turns, in leisure as well as in <strong>competition<\/strong>.<h2>I also have a lot of kart accessories that come in handy!<\/h2>\nI like the thrill but I don't like to be caught off guard and above all, it is essential for me to drive safely. That's why I invested in a digital <strong>pressure gauge<\/strong> that measures the pressure of my wheels and records my lap time, I also bought a cover so that my kart doesn't remain unnecessarily exposed to the elements and I have a very practical tire bag to make sure I'm operational. You don't have to buy the same accessories as I did, because the most important thing is to equip yourself according to your real needs. Karting safely is easy. The most important thing is to take care of the quality of your protective equipment and to make sure that you have a perfectly functional kart. You'll have a great time!"}}
