The geographical location is just as important as it contributes to the well-being you will feel after your move. Seaside apartments are in ever-increasing demand. Find out why without delay.<!--more--><h2>To enjoy a splendid view<\/h2>\nImagine waking up every morning to a majestic sea and seeing that same sea seemingly merge with the starry sky every evening. Some seaside communities also overlook the mountains or open onto forest landscapes. It is the beauty of nature that stretches before your eyes, to contemplate at will! Depending on the orientation of the openings (windows, bay windows...) you could also admire a large part of the city at once. The apartments located on the highest <strong>floors<\/strong> are particularly advantageous. Indeed, the view becomes more interesting as you move away from the ground. This is due to the absence (or at least the considerable reduction) of obstacles that obstruct the view.<h2>To invest in a prestigious apartment<\/h2>\nThe <em>seaside<\/em> is appreciated by the elite. Actors, models, stars of the song... they are numerous to settle on the coast. This is because the setting is conducive to the construction and development of luxury apartments. With the democratization of financing solutions, these prestigious properties are now accessible to almost everyone. Indeed, <strong>luxury<\/strong> is more expensive. Nevertheless, you invest in stone and a seaside apartment is undeniably a refuge value. This ideally located apartment can be rented out. The income thus generated will be used to improve your living conditions or will be saved to ensure a comfortable old age. The real estate heritage that a seaside apartment represents can also be passed on to your descendants. Add to this the fact that a sale remains interesting if you need a larger apartment or, conversely, a smaller one.<h2>To see the sun rise and set over the sea<\/h2>\nThere are so many people who pay a lot of money for a stay by the sea, even if it's just for a weekend. They don't just come for the water recreation and good weather. Indeed, the sight of the sun rising or setting over the horizon is also one of the main attractions of coastal destinations. You don't see the time passing when you are facing this magnificence. It's so relaxing that stress flies away without difficulty. Moreover, this quietude is combined with the beauty of the phenomenon. The landscape changes colors, the light gives way to darkness or vice versa.

If you have children, you can share magical moments with your family.<h2>To enjoy the invigorating sea air<\/h2>\nSea air is appreciated for its purity. It contains more iodine and negative ions than the air that circulates in cities far from the sea. Sea air contains very few germs, which makes it better for your health. Sea air is also a valuable ally for the skin. That's because it's full of salt, which is enriched with trace elements and minerals that promote cell regeneration. It is a common misconception that sea salt causes skin dryness. In reality, it is prolonged exposure to the sun that causes this problem. So make sure to protect yourself from UV rays and you'll find that your skin is naturally cleansed every time it is exposed to the sea air. Beyond the health and beauty benefits, the sea air is a natural invigorator. Every morning, open your window wide and treat yourself to a breath of fresh sea air. You'll be energized for the day. The same goes for when you come home exhausted. Take a deep breath and let the magic happen.<h2>If you live in Nice, to have the chance to have a sea view on the Promenade des Anglais<\/h2>\nNice is one of the most famous and popular seaside cities.

They can also be requested by owners who wish to know the potential risks and therefore the work to be considered.<h2><!--more-->Understanding the key terms<\/h2>\nEach diagnosis is established for a specific purpose. It is therefore important to understand the purpose of each one. If you are looking for a professional opinion\/advice concerning <strong>real estate diagnostics<\/strong>, go to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amiantediagnostic.fr\/\">www.amiantediagnostic.fr.<\/a><h2>The state of risks and pollution (ERP)<\/h2>\nSome areas are exposed to risks that may be natural, chemical, seismic, mining.... A prefectoral decree defines the list of concerned communes in each department. When a property is built in such a zone, it is obliged to establish a state of risks and pollution. The<strong>ERP<\/strong> is valid for 6 months and applies to buildings as well as to land and plots. The document must be attached to the promise or the deed of sale in case of sale of the property concerned. The landlords are also required to attach it to the lease. This diagnosis engages the responsibility of the <em>owner <\/em>who is liable to a fine of 300 000\u20ac and possibly 2 years of imprisonment. It is therefore essential to use a certified professional diagnostician to fill out the form. Penalties apply in case of false information and failure to voluntarily transmit the ERP to the buyer\/tenant.<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-324\" src=\"http:\/\/zrezgc90.ot-damgan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/diagnostic-immobilier.jpg\" alt=\"diagnostic immobilier\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" \/><h2>The report of the risks of exposure to lead (CREP)<\/h2>\nOlder<em> homes<\/em>, and more specifically those built before 1949, must be subject to a report on the risks of exposure to lead, a substance present in most old paints. The diagnosis consists of evaluating the <strong>lead<\/strong> concentration. The diagnostician directs his research on the coatings like paintings but also bricks and other old elements. If the exterior coatings such as shutters are old, they are also subject to a search for the presence of lead. In the same way, all the annexes built in anticipation of a current use (garage, laundry room...) must be diagnosed. The document is to be filled in by a certified professional who indicates both the concentration of lead and the state of conservation of the analyzed elements. A notice must be attached to the document to inform the owner\/tenant about the health risks. In case of sale, the seller must provide a Crep of less than 1 year if the lead concentration is higher or equal to 1 mg\/cm\u00b2. This validity is extended to 6 years in case of a positive result. The validity is unlimited if the diagnosis reveals a lead content lower than 1 mg\/cm\u00b2.<h2>Asbestos diagnosis<\/h2>\nAlso called<strong>asbestos<\/strong> condition, this diagnosis is mandatory for all buildings whose building permit dates from before July 1977. It confirms the presence or absence of asbestos, a material harmful to health. If the diagnosis dates from before April 1, 2013, it must be redone. On the other hand, the validity is unlimited for the asbestos statements made since this same date of reference. It is nevertheless wise to request a new diagnosis following renovation work because the interventions could highlight the presence of asbestos not previously detected.<h2>The gas diagnosis<\/h2>\nA large number of homes are supplied with<strong> gas<\/strong> to cover needs as varied as cooking and heating. Nevertheless, the obsolescence of the installations constitutes a risk for the safety of the occupants. Since November 1, 2007, a gas diagnosis is therefore mandatory with the objective of verifying the state of the interior installations dating back more than 15 years. In addition to the main building, the outbuildings are also concerned by this diagnosis. It describes the state of the appliances and fixed piping, the layout of the installation spaces and the state of the accessories. The gas diagnosis must be carried out before the property is put up for sale or rented. It is carried out according to a strictly regulated methodology which requires the intervention of a qualified professional. It should be noted that the diagnosis does not require the dismantling of the installations. The report determines the actions to be taken, either as soon as possible or with the possibility of scheduling the work later. The diagnosis is valid for 3 years.<h2>Lead diagnosis<\/h2>\nThe danger of lead for health was only noticed late, which explains why traces of this substance are still found in many buildings. The presence of lead is however a common cause of lead poisoning, but not only. The use of lead was common until 1948. It was mainly incorporated into paints, increasing the toxicity of constructions prior to this period. The lead diagnosis is carried out upstream of the Crep, the latter dealing mainly with the risks related to exposure to the material. Diagnosticians use a device equipped with a radioactive source to determine whether or not lead is present. A positive report is valid for 1 year in the case of a sale and 6 years in the case of a rental. Negative reports are valid for an unlimited period.<h2>Electricity diagnosis<\/h2>\nJust like the gas diagnosis, the <strong>electricity <\/strong>diagnosis is required for all housing where the electrical installation was made more than 15 years ago. It aims to check the state of the network in order to identify any weaknesses in the installation and therefore to plan the necessary corrective measures. The electricity diagnosis cannot be performed by an electrician. It is essential to entrust the task to a certified diagnostician who has the knowledge required to observe, analyze and determine the condition of the installation. The intervention is limited to the external circuit, which is sufficient to inform future occupants of the quality of the network. In case of sale, the electricity diagnosis is valid for 3 years. In the case of a rental, its validity is spread over 6 years.<h2>The diagnosis of energy performance (DPE)<\/h2>\nOur energy consumption is not without consequences on the environment. The <strong>DPE<\/strong> aims to analyze these impacts. The DPE allows to rate each home on a scale of <em>energy performance<\/em>. On the one hand, it evaluates the capacity of the construction to save or not the energy used. On the other hand, the DPE offers the possibility of determining the rate of greenhouse gas emissions of the same housing. The result of the DPE is valid for 10 years. However, it must be redone if renovations are made before the end of this period that could modify it. The real estate diagnostics to be undertaken are therefore generally conditioned by the age of the construction. In all cases, the diagnostician must be certified and the document provided to candidates for purchase or rental must be up to date, under penalty of sanctions."},"translate-8":{"url":"what to do-winter-holidays","title":"9 activities to do during the winter vacations","h1":"What to do during the winter vacations?","contenu":"Winter <strong>vacations <\/strong>may not be as long as summer vacations, but that doesn't stop you from making the most of them.

If you live (or stay) in a snowy area, you'll just need to bundle up before making the three traditional snowballs. The snow must be wet enough, otherwise it will be difficult to pack. Make a large ball for the bottom of your man, then a medium one for his upper body and finally a small one for his head. Place the nose in the middle of the face. If it is customary to use a carrot, you can also use a red ball, a piece of painted wood... be creative. For the eyes, ping-pong balls, buttons or pieces of coal will be perfect. Just make sure they are symmetrical. Finish with a mouth made from the same objects used for the eyes or cut out of a plastic\/rubber pipe that has been folded. All that's left to do is to dress your snowman with a hat, a cap, a scarf, a jacket... it's up to you. You don't have snow at home or maybe you want snowmen that won't melt? Stack canning jars of different sizes or line white socks to shape the bodies of your snowmen and then add details with felt, stickers or buttons. For home decor, used light bulbs and milk bottles are among the easiest options to make.<h2>A wellness trip to a spa<\/h2>\nIt's been a long year and you've probably had your share of stress over the past few months. The winter vacations offer you the opportunity to decompress and recharge before tackling the new year. There's nothing like a wellness vacation to revitalize you, so plan a <strong>weekend<\/strong> or multi-day getaway and indulge in some relaxing treatments. There are many packages to choose from, so you are free to select the treatments you want. Don't hesitate to offer yourself duo sessions to share moments of pure well-being with your soul mate or a friend. Of course, you won't spend all your days at the spa. So choose a destination that offers you other perspectives that can be cultural, gastronomic, historical....<h2>Spend the weekend in a mountain chalet<\/h2>\nImagine a traditional <strong>chalet <\/strong>surrounded by a vast space where pine trees and snow are in perfect harmony. You'll light a beautiful fire in the fireplace to warm up while you enjoy your favorite hot drinks or simply to tell\/listen to stories by the fire. This may sound clich\u00e9, but it is always a source of infinite well-being. In addition, the mountain environment offers you many possibilities. Go hiking, roast marshmallows, make snowmen. Depending on the destination, you can go ice fishing or simply enjoy the peace and quiet that surrounds you. A weekend in a chalet also offers you the prospect of cutting yourself off from the world and temporarily forgetting your hectic lifestyle.<h2>Discover the French Riviera to enjoy the superb climate<\/h2>\nThe legendary good weather of the French <strong>Riviera<\/strong> makes it a perfect<em> destination<\/em> for your winter vacation... in the sun. Nice has more than just water sports to offer. Discover its emblematic places like the Promenade des Anglais or the Place Mass\u00e9na which lights up at the end of November or beginning of December. Stroll around the Christmas village, attend shows, skate under the sun. There is always something to do under the blue sky. The winter vacations are also ideal to visit museums without having to elbow each other because there are fewer people than in summer. In Menton, a giant ice rink takes place in front of the Halles from the beginning of December and during 4 weeks. The Biov\u00e8s gardens are transformed into an enchanted forest where merry-go-rounds, donkey rides and food stalls delight young and old. Christmas parades are also organized regularly in a shimmer of colors. You don't have to bundle up to enjoy the season and the enchantment it brings with it. The sun will even be out! If you come at the end of winter, you will have the opportunity to attend the Lemon Festival. Citrus fruits adorn the city and are served in many different ways. Winter in Cannes is a bit wet, which does not detract from the city's charm. The sea is sublime under the effect of the wind and the rain (light at the beginning of the winter). In 15 minutes, you will reach the island of Saint-Honorat, a perfect destination to enjoy the peace and quiet and taste good wine. Of course, you should not forget the Croisette and its beautiful luxury stores. You will find beautiful outfits for New Year's Eve, prestigious gifts to offer to your loved ones.... Go to the Vieux Port where champagne and seafood await you in the most prestigious restaurants and trendy bistros. Saint-Tropez, Valbonne, Mougins... each C\u00f4te d'Azur destination has its own identity, but each one reserves you a Christmas vacation combining enchantment, mild climate and authentic animations. It is advisable to <strong>rent a villa<\/strong> in anticipation of this stay. For this, choose <a href=\"https:\/\/www.john-taylor.fr\/\">the John Taylor real estate agency<\/a> that will meet all your requirements. You'll enjoy accommodation that offers all the comforts you need to feel at home. Moreover, renting a villa allows you to spend your vacations in a prestigious atmosphere.

If this is your first time, there is no need to worry. Find out what schools are available in the destination and go for it. If you're already experienced, even better. Skiing will work both your endurance and your strength. This all-around sport will help you burn a lot of calories, enough to compensate for the greedy splurges we like to indulge in during winter. Moreover, this family activity is excellent for your health since it optimizes oxygen supply and blood circulation. Your stay in the mountains will purify your body and the hours you will spend on the slopes will boost your mind. After the effort, the comfort! Ski destinations offer several off-piste activities. Tasting local specialties, dance parties, game workshops, there is no shortage of opportunities.<h2>... and sledding<\/h2>\nIt is also in the middle of <strong>nature<\/strong> that you can practice sledging, an activity that makes you laugh and forget the routine. It's a great way to get your muscles working. It is a sporty activity, ideal to keep fit during the winter vacations. Add to that the fact that speed brings its share of adrenaline and that the wind seduces by its invigorating side. Choose a well snowed and cleared space. The fewer obstacles there are, the safer it is. There is no guarantee that you won't fall, but that's part of the fun of sledding. Just let yourself slide and try to keep your balance.<h2>Going to the Christmas markets<\/h2>\nThe Christkindelsm\u00e4rik in Strasbourg is one of the most beautiful in Europe. It takes place on the Place Broglie but also in other parts of the city such as the Place d'Austerlitz or the Place de la Cath\u00e9drales. About 300 chalets take place, offering Alsatian pastries, gifts and decorations, but not only. A huge ice rink as well as shows and concerts also invite to enjoy this market which exists since 1570. The Christmas markets of Colmar are also very famous. The artisans meet in different places that form charming <strong>villages <\/strong>with sparkling decorations. For nearly six weeks, nearly 180 exhibitors keep the magic going in a setting that seems to come straight out of a fairy tale. The Christmas markets of the capital are also waiting for you at the Trocadero, in front of the Notre-Dame cathedral and on the famous avenue des Champs-Elys\u00e9es. The animations create sparks in the eyes of children and allow adults to appreciate the magic of the season.<h2>Go to the festival of lights<\/h2>\nHead to Lyon to attend this <strong>festival <\/strong>organized around December 8. For the occasion, the people of Lyon place small lamps called lumignons on their windowsills. The facades of the buildings are decorated with the most beautiful light decorations. Interactive shows are organized throughout the city. Ephemeral works, surprisingly realistic installations... the route is punctuated with enchantments.<h2>Try the winter culinary specialties<\/h2>\nWinter is the perfect season to savor many traditional recipes. Raclette is obviously at the top of the list. This assortment of cheeses and charcuterie promises a ballet of exceptional flavors. Comforting, hot chestnuts abound on Christmas markets. Enjoy them plain, as an accompaniment to the Christmas turkey or drizzled with a hot chocolate sauce at the end of the meal. Fondue is another must. Abondance and Beaufort are the big stars in Savoyard cuisine. The preparation is sometimes enriched with a little Emmental de Savoie. If you are staying in the Jura, the fondue can be enriched with Comt\u00e9 cheese. The best winter vacations are those that you can enjoy as you please, in a spirit of freedom and lightness. No matter how much time you have, the most important thing is to live every moment to the fullest to finish (or start) the year in beauty."},"translate-9":{"url":"criteres-agence-immobiliere-luxe","title":"The criteria of a good real estate agency","h1":"What are the criteria that a luxury real estate agency must have?","contenu":"Real estate is a safe investment as long as you are well accompanied.

Therefore, you can ask for information from traders in the<em> area<\/em> where you want to sell\/buy. It is also possible to get information online by consulting sites dedicated to verified reviews, forums or directly on the agency's website. Feedback from previous clients should be mostly positive and information circulating elsewhere should also be positive. Reliability can be measured by transparency. A good agency specialized in luxury real estate provides its contact information, gives precise information about its fees, details its <strong>services....<\/strong><h2>Be serious<\/h2>\nWhen it comes to luxury real estate, it is not the quantity of transactions that counts but the quality. This requires solid skills in managing human relations and ensuring a tailor-made follow-up. You should not be just a file number! A serious agency will give you the time you need.<h2>Be attentive to your needs<\/h2>\nThis is a fundamental quality to be able to identify your expectations. Listening and empathy are combined to ensure a perfect understanding of your needs. The agents dedicated to your project will then be able to interpret your request accurately and thus establish the basis of their prospecting mission. A team that listens to you is able to offer <em>tailor-made<\/em> services. If you sell, the agency will be able to argue so that your high-end property finds a <strong>buyer<\/strong>. It is not only a question of selling quickly but of really adding value. If you are buying, the agency will take into account your profile: a luxury property near a school for a family, a property near the sea for water sports enthusiasts ....<h2>Being professional<\/h2>\nProfessionalism is reflected in the constant desire to evolve. A good agency is not satisfied with arguing about its number of years of existence and experience. It is regularly informed about new regulations, uses innovative tools made available by technology. Professionalism is also measured by the quality of the support. A good <strong>luxury real estate agency<\/strong>, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.haussmannrealestate.fr\/\">Haussmann Real Estate<\/a>, will not hesitate to contact you regularly to inform you of the progress of your project.<h2>Respect your budget<\/h2>\nLuxury has a price, it's true. If the rates are higher than in traditional real estate, it does not mean that you have to spend an excessive amount of money. You have probably already evaluated your budget and this is a criterion that must be taken into consideration by the agency. If the amount you are ready to spend does not fit the market realities, the agency will be able to make you relevant proposals. For example, it is possible to extend the search area to a few kilometers around. It is also possible to review the criteria (a few square meters less, a balcony with a sea view rather than a large<em> furnished terrace<\/em>...).

He or she will be able to make proposals that effectively meet your requirements and will even be able to surprise you.<h2>Identify your needs<\/h2>\nYou have certainly already defined your criteria: environment, location, surface area, equipment, number of rooms, architectural and decorative style.... A good agency will be able to condense all the information you provide in order to select properties likely to make you fall in love with them.<h2>Giving relevant advice<\/h2>\nThe Internet is now a valuable source of information. Even if you can find detailed articles, nothing beats the advice of a specialist. A competent real estate agency will inform you on the elements to prioritize such as real estate diagnoses, renovation possibilities, options to give more character to your property and so on. The advice can cover different areas, including technical, legal and financial issues. If necessary, the agency will direct you to a specialized professional.<h2>Being responsive<\/h2>\nA luxury real estate agent who masters his trade knows how to recognize <em>opportunities<\/em>. He can therefore be ahead of his competitors to obtain the exclusive right to sell a property. He is always on the lookout for new developments in his sector but also for what is being done elsewhere. The most important thing is that he can offer you a quality follow-up. You will not need to follow up with him, the agent will come back to you regularly to give you news.<h2>Be demanding<\/h2>\nKnowledge, rigor and interpersonal skills are essential in the world of prestige real estate. The requirement is therefore self-evident because the smallest detail is very important. The agent takes a close interest in the quality of the finishes, the level of comfort, the construction materials, the view, the exposure and other elements that allow a property to be classified in the prestige category.<h2>Presenting premium properties<\/h2>\nA good luxury real estate agency must dedicate its entire expertise to premium properties. All <em>apartments, villas and houses<\/em> are therefore subject to extremely high selection criteria.

It is a volcanic island with an area of 2034 km\u00b2. If it is quite populated, it also offers vast natural spaces that attract many tourists every year.<!--more-->The tourist activity remains the main revenue of the local economy. The island even has two UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Teide National Park and the city of San Cristobal de la Laguna. Tenerife lends itself easily to multiple activities and I would like to share with you my experience and the activities I tried during my stay in the Canaries.<h2>1\/ Flying over the beaches and landscapes of Tenerife in paraglider<\/h2>\nTo get off the beaten track and take full advantage of the beautiful landscapes of the<em>island<\/em>, you need to get a bit of height. Paragliding is the perfect activity to discover the beaches of Tenerife from the sky. As a beginner, the tandem flight reassured me completely. I was afraid of vertigo, but I was finally inhabited by a feeling of extreme softness and a feeling of total relaxation. I went to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.paradise-tenerife.com\/\">https:\/\/www.paradise-tenerife.com\/<\/a> for my <strong>first paragliding experience<\/strong>, and it was great. The take-off zones are located in several places and are accessible within an hour's drive from the hotels. I opted for the beach flight with incredible views of the ocean and a soft landing on the sand. The turquoise waters below us, the pristine sky, the jagged coastline and small resorts, all take on another dimension and it feels like you're gliding gently through the air, like a dream. Other paragliding options exist in other places.<h2>2\/ Go hiking to the Teide volcano<\/h2>\nThe Pico del Teide is the highest point in all of Spain and stands proudly on the island of Tenerife at 3715 m. It is the place to go for a hike in the center of the island. This <strong>volcano<\/strong> is an emblematic place of the Canaries and offers atypical landscapes. The ascent to the summit can be done by cable car which drops the hikers at less than 1 km from the summit but still leaves a nice difference in height of 200 m. I chose the more sportive option from the parking of Montana Bianca (2300 m of altitude). 8 km of trails for a difference in altitude of 1800 m! It is necessary to plan between 3 and 5 hours to reach the top of the volcano. The path crosses a national park of any beauty. The presence of the national park imposes some constraints like the limited number of tourists per day (150), so it is necessary to obtain a passage permit beforehand. There is a refuge and I did the ascent in two days to balance the efforts and enjoy the sumptuous sunrises and sunsets. I was marked by the part of the hike above the clouds and by the temperature differences but especially by the <em>landscapes<\/em>, I thought I was on another planet, it was hallucinating.<h2>3\/ Visit the villages of Masca and Santa Cruz<\/h2>\nThe <strong>village of Masca<\/strong> on the eastern part of the island is without doubt the place that made the biggest impression on me. This small hamlet is nestled in a kind of mountainous cirque and offers really impressive panoramas. If there was only one image to keep of Tenerife, it would be the one of Masca. The atypical place is an emblematic concentrate of this so singular nature. These steep mountains that tear the sky, these viewpoints that lead to the sea in the distance between two crevices give impressions of the end of the world. The place is so remote that there are few accommodation possibilities.<strong>Santa Cruz<\/strong> is the capital of the island. It is located in the north of Tenerife. It is a very cosmopolitan old city. I found it very pleasant to stroll in the pedestrian streets of the city center, they are lively and colorful, there are plenty of stores. I liked the heterogeneous side of the architecture. Indeed, the historical buildings are easily mixed with more contemporary constructions, which provides a great variety.<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-382\" src=\"http:\/\/zrezgc90.ot-damgan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/activite-tenerife.jpg\" alt=\"activite tenerife\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" \/>The city also has a high number of parks where works of art are sometimes exposed. You can also enjoy the coastline and the beaches. The less frequented beaches are further away from the city center, I loved the Teresitas beach with its palm trees, not far from the charming fishing village of San Andres.<h2>4\/ Discover the pyramids of G\u00fc\u00edmar in the east of Tenerife<\/h2>\nIn the south east of the island is the <strong>ethnographic park of G\u00fcimar <\/strong>which houses step pyramids like those found in Peru. Their origin is unclear, they are 4 m high and there are six of them. Inside the park, several thematic tours allow visitors to discover the site while learning about botany with endemic plants and unique poisonous plants, local culture and history, and the volcanoes of the Canaries. An exhibition room also presents a space dedicated to the history of navigation in <em>the Pacific Ocean<\/em>. Finally, a museum is dedicated to the findings of the Norwegian anthropologist Thor Heyerdhal who discovered the pyramids and his theories on their origin.<h2>5\/ The beach of Los Gigantes<\/h2>\nImagine a black sand <strong>beach <\/strong>, surrounded by volcanic cliffs plunging into crystal clear waters, you are not dreaming, this place exists: it is the beach of Los Gigantes. The place is really beautiful and the cliffs of Los Gigantes are very impressive. With a kayak you can get close to the steep cliffs. I preferred to enjoy a natural swimming pool right next to the ocean where the water was very pleasant without too many waves. The fishing village of Los Gigantes is really a haven of peace. An ideal site for a lazy day, feet in the water. Bonus : Attend the carnival of Tenerife What would be Santa Cruz without its annual carnival ? During one week, the city lives to the rhythm of music and party. Tourists and locals enjoy themselves and live to the sound of local bands that deliver Caribbean music in a unique atmosphere. It is the most famous carnival after Rio. It goes on all night in a very festive but also family atmosphere. It is punctuated by several corsos and parades which are very expected. It is one of the major festivals of Tenerife. This little piece of<strong>Spain<\/strong> in the middle of the ocean is really worth the detour and suits all tastes. I really enjoyed my stay and was able to discover the many facets of this charming island. The short flight ensures a complete change of scenery far from the beaten track, I highly recommend it."},"translate-11":{"url":"diagnostic-amiante-positif","title":"Positive asbestos diagnosis : how to react ?","h1":"What to do in case of a positive asbestos diagnosis?","contenu":"In the 1970s, asbestos was considered a miracle <strong>building material<\/strong>.

In other cases, it may happen that the price of the diagnosis is entirely assumed by the buyer.<h2>What is the purpose of a real estate diagnostic?<\/h2>\nA <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ot-damgan.com\/lexique-diagnostic-immobilier\/\">real estate diagnostic<\/a> is used to make a technical assessment of the property as it stands at the time of sale or rental. Among other things, it informs the future buyer of the possible <em>upgrades<\/em> he will have to make once the sale is concluded.<img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-394\" src=\"http:\/\/zrezgc90.ot-damgan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/diagnostic-amiante-positif-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"diagnostic amiante positif\" width=\"566\" height=\"424\" \/>The owner can carry out the diagnosis alone in two areas: natural risks and technological risks. The other diagnostics must be carried out by a professional diagnostician.<span style=\"color: #00ccff;\">To know : <\/span><ul>\n \t<li>What is the condition of the electrical installation (if it is more than 15 years old)<\/li>\n \t<li>What is the condition of the gas installation (also if it was installed more than 15 years ago)<\/li>\n \t<li>What is the energy performance of the property (also called DPE)<\/li>\n \t<li>Is there any lead in the materials of the apartment or house? If so, what is the risk for the future inhabitants to be exposed to it?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nFinally, the diagnostician looks for the presence of asbestos. Here again, he evaluates if this presence poses a risk to the users of the property.<h2>The legislation on asbestos<\/h2>\nIn France, it was in 1906 that the question of the link between exposure to asbestos and the occurrence of serious health problems was first raised. In Caen, a labor inspector alerted the public to the high mortality rate among workers in asbestos spinning factories. This was followed by events and decisions that led, among other things, to the obligation to take asbestos into account in <strong>real estate diagnostics<\/strong>.<ul>\n \t<li>In 1973, asbestos was classified as a carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.<\/li>\n \t<li>In January 1997, the decree number 96-1133 prohibits the use of asbestos in France.<\/li>\n \t<li>In 1999, a European directive provides for a total ban on asbestos in all member countries by 2005.<\/li>\n \t<li>2002 saw the implementation of an important standard: the AFNOR NF X 46-020 standard. It describes the procedure that must be put in place to perform an asbestos diagnosis. It is explained how to identify materials containing asbestos in old buildings.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Asbestos diagnosis: definition<\/h2>\nAll properties built before 1997 are subject to the obligation of an asbestos diagnosis if they are in one of these cases: <strong>sale<\/strong>, <strong>rental<\/strong> or work. These diagnoses are recorded and can be consulted by the future users of the place. A tenant, for example, may ask to have access to the <em>DAPP<\/em> (the Asbestos File of Private Parts). All <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ot-damgan.com\/mes-astuces-pour-faire-de-bonnes-affaires-immobilieres\/\">real estate<\/a> is concerned by this diagnosis, since it concerns businesses, individual houses, as well as collective buildings. If the diagnosis aims to inform future tenants or owners of property, it can also influence the progress of a construction site. If asbestos has been found on the site, the project manager is obliged to warn all the companies that are supposed to take part in the work. Also, the individuals attending the<em> site<\/em> must receive training in asbestos and a mandatory medical follow-up.<h2>Procedure of the asbestos diagnosis<\/h2>\nThis is always carried out by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amiantediagnostic.fr\/\">an independent professional asbestos diagnostician<\/a>. He starts by visiting the building or house and, initially, he simply looks for the presence of asbestos with the naked eye. If asbestos is found, the expert will take samples for<em>analysis<\/em>. The latter will confirm his initial findings. Then, he evaluates the degree of degradation of the asbestos elements. According to this degree, he can recommend future <strong>works<\/strong> (confinement) which will help to avoid the dispersion of particles. He can also recommend a pure and simple removal of the problematic elements.<h2>What measures should be taken in case of a positive asbestos diagnosis ?<\/h2>\nIf the diagnosis has revealed the presence of asbestos among the materials in your property, action will undoubtedly be required. Normally, for each zone detected, the diagnostician has defined one of three regulatory levels. The first level does not commit you to anything, except to regularly monitor the element in question. The second level obliges you to restore the area where the asbestos is degraded, in order to prevent the emission of particles into the ambient air. The third level requires the complete removal of the asbestos materials. It may be tempting to do the work yourself. However, you should know that this will certainly lead to difficulties, and even problems with the law. Indeed, an intervention on a premises containing asbestos requires heavy safety measures. Without these measures, you are putting your <strong>health <\/strong>and that of others at serious risk. Similarly, if you do not dispose of asbestos-containing materials in specialized waste disposal facilities, you expose yourself to legal action. Our teams of professionals are experienced in asbestos containment and removal. They have been rigorously trained to work in these particular conditions and are able to act without taking any risk, neither for them nor for you. In addition, the experts have their own network and know where to get rid of asbestos while respecting the law and the environment."},"translate-12":{"url":"why-buy-in-grece","title":"7 good reasons to buy a property in Greece","h1":"Why buy in Greece?","contenu":"If you wish to <strong>buy a property<\/strong> in Greece to give your life a new dimension, a new color, you will be pleasantly surprised to discover the many advantages offered by this country to property buyers. <!--more-->Living outside of France for vacations, part-time or full time, is an ambition that many compatriots have realized. There is no need to go far away to get a complete change of scenery. We suggest you, for once, not to block your ears and to let yourself be guided by the siren song to the wonderful country of Ulysses.<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-401\" src=\"http:\/\/zrezgc90.ot-damgan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/grece-plage.jpg\" alt=\"grece plage\" width=\"508\" height=\"678\" \/>Greece has many assets for those who want to make a real estate <strong>investment<\/strong> and the following 7 key points will convince you. This was the case for me after having consulted the<a href=\"https:\/\/agence-immobiliere-mobilia.fr\/\">real estate agency Mobilia<\/a> of which my <em>Athenian<\/em> friends had spoken to me in the best terms. I can say that this agency accompanied me very well in the choice and the purchase of my second home in the sun.<h2>1 : Everyday life at low prices<\/h2>\nYou have to go shopping in the local or village markets to realize how easy and pleasant it is to get fresh products for modest prices compared to those charged in French cities. It is not uncommon to find seasonal fruits and vegetables for between one and two euros, a nice salad for 50 cents. Fish and meat are always of good quality at prices that would make more than one dream in France. For other consumer goods, moderation is the rule even if the various crises that have shaken the country in recent years have upset the balance a little. Let's not be mistaken. This flattering portrait only applies to foreigners whose salaries are much higher than those of Greeks, who struggle to live comfortably.<h2>2: Greece, a Mediterranean climate with a scent of eternity<\/h2>\n\"Let's go to the south of France or to other southern countries and we will also have a <em>Mediterranean climate<\/em> \", some will say. But this would be without counting on the multitude of climatic particularities of the Aegean Sea as well as the archipelagos that the gods have scattered over the blue and diaphanous waters of Greece.\n\nLiving in Greece means saying \"You\" to the light and nature almost all year round, living all day long between the captivating nature, the enchanting seaside and the terraces and good restaurants of the many taverns. Whether in the city, in the country or <strong>by the sea<\/strong>, the property you will buy will offer you the magic of its terrace all year round.<h2>3: Buying a property in Greece where prices are much lower than in France<\/h2>\nDepending on the location and the type of property you buy, the average prices per square meter may surprise you by being three to four times lower than in France, especially in privileged areas. A seaside villa in <strong>Greece <\/strong>has nothing to do with the asking price of a property in the south of France. Moreover, and provided that you follow your possible work, you will find qualified craftsmen who will allow you to renovate your property at affordable prices. The prices of the real estate market in Greece will allow you, in comparison with the French market, to size your real estate project at a much higher level in terms of location, surface and land with the same budget.<h2>4 : Keep all the advantages of the European Union by buying in Greece<\/h2>\nInvesting in real estate in Greece means choosing stability and keeping the same rules of the game, the same social guarantees and the same currency. The legal guarantees will be the same and you will not be considered as a foreigner, but as a European citizen. All <em>administrative<\/em> and legal <em>procedures<\/em> will be easier.<h2>5 : Buy in Greece and benefit from an advantageous tax system<\/h2>\nAs everywhere else, when you buy your property, you will have to pay taxes and fees that will be added to the price of the transaction. However, these additional amounts are less than in France and the <strong>taxes <\/strong>you will pay each year will surprise you pleasantly when you compare them to the level of taxation in France. In addition, the Greek government has established new tax rules that are very advantageous for European retirees who come to live in Greece. This makes buying a house or an apartment even more attractive. A good real estate agency will also be able to guide you on tax issues.<h2>6 : Gateway to the East and Gateway to Europe, Greece is a reassuringly distant neighbour<\/h2>\nBuying a property in Greece does not lead to the difficult expatriation that some compatriots experience when they leave for distant horizons. Greece is the ideal place to explore new frontiers, to give in to a total change of scenery with all the advantages of remaining within the sphere of the<strong>European Union<\/strong>. Crossroads between East and West, Greece is two or three hours' flight from all the major European cities. There are many reliable airlines. In addition, apart from the train, domestic connections by plane, road and boat are very efficient throughout the country.<h2>7: Buying in Greece: living in the garden of human history<\/h2>\nTo be comfortably installed on the terrace and to contemplate the Acropolis, the Aegean Sea, the white villages, one of the numerous ancient sites, a fishermen's port or a beach well sheltered in its cove, the whole bathed in an incomparable light in a summer which seems eternal, here are your dreams within reach. The property you will buy will certainly place you in the heart of a scene where you will feel like a hero every day, following in the footsteps of Demosthenes and so many other men and <em>myths <\/em>who, century after century, have forged the culture and history of our Humanity.\n\nIt is said, for example, that Greece has so many beaches and coves that a lifetime would not be enough to explore them all. Add the historical sites, the natural sites and the places of entertainment and culture and you will be sure never to miss a single opportunity to discover and learn from everyday life.\n\nYou will certainly have the opportunity to reflect on your good fortune as you sit quietly on a terrace over hearty mezze and local wine while a tasty fish is carved fresh from the water that morning. As for many others before you, it will become clear that by purchasing a property you will not only have acquired a <strong>residence<\/strong>, but more importantly, opened up an infinite world of discovery, pleasure and well-being."},"translate-13":{"url":"card-gold-practice-acquisitions","title":"Why choose the gold card for your purchases?","h1":"Gold card: the essential tool for all your purchases!","contenu":"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Would you like more information about the famous gold card?

Luxury real estate is particularly popular as the Mediterranean environment and the prestige that prevails on the French Riviera satisfy the most stringent requirements. However, it is important to keep in mind that luxury real estate is a rather special investment area, and properties must meet specific criteria in order to belong to the high-end segment. The assistance of a competent agency is therefore essential. Discover the options through which you can find a qualified team in luxury real estate.<!--more--><h2>The real estate sector<\/h2>\nThe French real estate <em>market <\/em>is remarkably resilient. While the health and economic crisis has affected the majority of economic sectors, real estate has never run out of steam. In August 2021, a new historical record was recorded thanks to the 1,208,000 old properties that found takers in one year. This corresponds to an increase of 23% in the volume of transactions over a 12-month period. In the new housing market, the issue of building permits has been slowed down by the pandemic context. A penalizing trend has therefore been observed since 2020, which has caused the number of <em>transactions <\/em>over 12 months to explode (+12% at the end of March and +45% at the end of June), with prices rising by around 7.4% in 2021. A trend that is accompanied by a stability in the rates applied to real estate loans. However, the new provisions enacted by the HCSF (High Council for Financial Stability) are not without consequence. The regulatory overhaul aims to optimize the security of <em>loans<\/em>, which goes hand in hand with the tightening of conditions imposed by banking institutions. At the beginning of the second quarter of 2022, several banks revised their rates, applying an increase of 0.05 to 0.45 points. The pandemic has changed the search criteria of the French, who are leaning towards an urban exodus, although major cities still retain their attractiveness to buyers. Houses with gardens are particularly sought after. Those wishing to acquire small spaces prefer properties with a balcony or terrace.<h2>Luxury real estate<\/h2>\n <strong>High-end<\/strong> real estate is a very special segment. The notion of exclusivity is extremely important. No detail should be overlooked: the atmosphere of the neighborhood, the security, the construction materials, the architectural style, the type of configuration, the services included... Of course, the budget required is much more consequent. Before the pandemic period, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ot-damgan.com\/criteres-agence-immobiliere-luxe\/\">luxury real estate<\/a> attracted a French clientele and foreign investors. The restrictions have had an impact on these trends and international clients have gradually withdrawn from the market. The French, on the other hand, have continued to show interest in the high-end market. In June 2020, 38% of French people felt that the time was right to invest in luxury real estate. In May 2021, this proportion reached 64%. Investors are accelerating the realization of their purchase projects in the face of the shortage of property. Among the most popular geographic areas, we can mention the <strong>PACA region<\/strong>, which includes all types of luxury properties. Buyers are interested in apartments, villas, <em>manors<\/em> and castles. For more than 60% of them, the acquisition projects concern their main residence.<h2>Discover the city of Saint Jean Cap Ferrat<\/h2>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-440\" src=\"http:\/\/zrezgc90.ot-damgan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/villa-ephrussi-de-rotchild-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Monument pr\u00e9sent pr\u00e8s de la villa ephrussi\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" \/>\n<h3>The city and its centers of interest<\/h3>\nThe success of Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat with celebrities began in the 1950s, allowing the peninsula to develop an identity closely linked to prestige. Luxurious buildings nestled in impeccably maintained gardens and parks multiplied. Imposing villas such as Maryland, Les Bruy\u00e8res, Santo Sospir, La Vigie, la Fleur du Cap or <em>Ephrussi-de-Rothschild<\/em> illustrate the architectural wealth. Museums such as the Coquillages Museum, green spaces such as Cedars, and magnificent beaches such as La Paloma, Les Fossettes and Cros de\u00ef Pin offer many opportunities to relax and discover Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat.<h3>Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat luxury real estate: the favorite districts<\/h3>\nSaint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat is a territory where the notion of luxury is omnipresent. Prestigious properties are available in most of the <strong>neighborhoods<\/strong>. However, there are some areas that are more desirable to investors, such as the Promenade Maurice Rouvier and the Passable beach, which are popular for the spectacular views they offer. The area around the port is also popular because it allows you to immerse yourself in the authentic atmosphere of the village, which covers 2.48 km\u00b2.<h2>Luxury real estate in Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat : look for a real estate agency on the internet<\/h2>\nDigital tools and in particular internet platforms allow you to optimize the search time and the relevance of the results. By specifying the geographical area that interests you and by specifying that you are only interested in luxury real estate, you refine the list of agencies that appear on your screen. Take the time to visit their sites. Don't just skim the pages, but linger over the different contents. Read the agency's presentation, look at the types of properties for sale or rent, and linger over the news published and the advice posted online. A good <strong>luxury real estate agency in Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat<\/strong>, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.haussmannrealestate.fr\/saint-jean-cap-ferrat\">Haussmann real estate<\/a> for example, must be able to offer you complete and high quality information.

Ask your friends and family to explain their recommendations in order to understand what they liked best about the agency's service and support.<h2>Luxury real estate Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat : word of mouth<\/h2>\nThe efficiency of word of mouth is formidable because the reputation of a luxury real estate agency is forged above all on the opinions of its customers. Satisfactory services are automatically the subject of positive feedback. Previous clients talk about them and information circulates quickly. If an agency is recommended to you by various sources, do not hesitate to follow this track.<h2>Luxury real estate Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat : the first appointment<\/h2>\nReal estate projects must be carefully thought out and studied, especially when you are interested in the luxury segment. This is why you should form a personal opinion about the real estate agency before entrusting your project to them. Based on your research and\/or recommendations, establish contact and make an appointment. Physical meetings are ideal, but it is also possible to arrange an appointment via digital tools. At this stage, you can measure the reactivity of the agency according to the delay of response to your request but also according to its promptness to meet you. On the day, it will be essential that your interlocutor listens to your needs and makes the first relevant suggestions while respecting the criteria that you have defined.<h2>Luxury real estate Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat : trust your instinct<\/h2>\nThe first meeting will leave you with a first impression that you should not neglect. Indeed, intuition is rarely wrong. If you feel confident and if you are already convinced that the real estate agency will live up to your expectations, then you can continue the discussion. In short, it is essential to evaluate the skills of a real estate agency before requesting their assistance. Choose a team that is exclusively dedicated to luxury properties in Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat.

Are you planning to offer <strong>furnished rentals<\/strong> as the main residence of your future tenants? Do you prefer to rent empty? The different types of rentals each have their advantages and come with certain constraints. For example, a furnished rental allows you to provide your tenants with a ready-to-live-in property, but it also requires that you maintain the furniture and equipment in good condition. An unfurnished home requires the tenant to furnish themselves, which reduces the amount of your investment and allows future occupants to furnish the space to their liking. The location of your <strong>property<\/strong> is critical in that you will need to consider local market trends to identify the most profitable rental options and adjust the rent accordingly.<h2>Don't forget to carry out all the mandatory diagnostics<\/h2>\nFurnished house, empty apartment...whatever the type of property you are renting, you must imperatively foresee <strong>real estate diagnostics<\/strong>. The DPE (diagnosis of energy performance) is mandatory. It allows you to situate the property on a scale from A to G concerning the quality of the insulation, the energy consumption and the emission of greenhouse gases. For any property built before 1949, the lead diagnosis is also required. You should also consider drawing up the ERNT (\u00e9tat des risques naturels miniers et technologiques) which informs potential tenants whether or not your property is located in a risk zone. In the case of a <strong>property<\/strong> located in a condominium, contact the property manager to obtain the diagnosis of the common areas. Note that the validity of the documents is not the same. Therefore, think about getting information as soon as possible from certified diagnosticians. Note that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ot-damgan.com\/diagnostics-immobiliers-obligatoires-avant-vente\/\">these real estate diagnoses are also mandatory when selling a property<\/a>. They are different depending on the type of property you wish to sell (apartment or house).<h2>Think about studying the competition before taking the plunge<\/h2>\n<strong> Rents<\/strong> vary greatly depending on the region. Moreover, neighborhoods located in the same city can reveal important disparities in rents. A wise landlord will therefore take the time to evaluate the local market before setting the rent. To do this, different criteria must be considered in addition to the location:<ul>\n \t<li>The size of the property<\/li>\n \t<li>The quality of the<strong> equipment <\/strong>provided in the case of furnished accommodation<\/li>\n \t<li>The standing (architectural style, quality of construction materials...)<\/li>\n \t<li>Additional facilities (cellar, attic space, parking, pool, etc.)<\/li>\n \t<li><\/li>\n<\/ul>\nFind out about similar properties and be particularly interested in the rents charged. You will be better positioned if you rent at a reasonable amount, whether it is for a seasonal or long-term rental. Be careful, this does not mean that you should underestimate the ideal amount of rent. If your services justify it, you may be able to set a higher <strong>price <\/strong>than the average.<h2>Get help from an agency to find a tenant<\/h2>\n[caption id=\"attachment_486\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"960\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/zrezgc90.ot-damgan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/agence-immobiliere.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-486 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/zrezgc90.ot-damgan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/agence-immobiliere-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"agence immobili\u00e8re\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" \/><\/a> A real estate agency will be of great help when renting an apartment[\/caption] Finding a <strong>tenant<\/strong> is often difficult for the landlord. Of course, you can write an ad (with photos) and publish it on specialized websites. This means that you will have to be available to answer calls and provide all the information requested by interested parties. You will also have to be available for visits, knowing that they do not necessarily lead to the signing of the lease. The easiest way to do this is to delegate the task to an agency positioned in the local market. Once the advertisement is published, the agency will study the files of the potential tenants in order to evaluate their solvency. Whether it is for furnished or empty accommodation, it is always more advantageous for the <strong>landlord<\/strong> to sign a rental contract with a person who has a good capacity to honor the rents. This limits the financial risks.<h2>Hire a chartered accountant to take full advantage of your income<\/h2>\nThe rental investment in a principal residence or in another type of housing generates <strong>land income<\/strong>. Managing this income is not as easy as it sounds. It is important to ensure that the rents are paid on time. If charges are excluded, you will have to invoice them in addition and make sure that they are collected regularly. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lmpartenaire.fr\/\">A chartered accountant will help you in your steps and will advise you on the optimal management of your rental income. As an experiment, I advise you to contact LM Partenaire<\/a>. Their professionals are experienced and will be able to accompany you in your real estate steps.<h2>You will of course have to subscribe to certain insurances and guarantees<\/h2>\nYou certainly know that you must opt for a <strong>home insurance<\/strong>. There are different formulas which go from a basic cover to a multi-risk home insurance. At the very least, you should take out insurance to cover possible damage to your property, since no property is immune to material damage. It is also advisable to include a guarantee against unpaid rent in your insurance contract. If your tenant is unable to pay the rent, you can use your insurance to continue to receive your income. Discuss this with the insurer, who will inform you of the conditions to be met and the terms of coverage. By comparing several proposals, you will more easily identify the offer that corresponds to your project of renting your property.<h2>Our advice for drawing up your rental contract<\/h2>\n[caption id=\"attachment_487\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"960\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/zrezgc90.ot-damgan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/contrat-de-location.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-487 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/zrezgc90.ot-damgan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/contrat-de-location-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"Exemple type d'un contrat de location\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" \/><\/a> It is essential to draw up your rental contract correctly[\/caption] After consulting with your <strong>real estate agency<\/strong>, you have selected your ideal tenant.

In the case of a furnished rental, an <strong>inventory of fixtures<\/strong> must be drawn up. An inventory of the equipment provided and its condition is essential. This inventory of fixtures must be renewed before the departure of the tenants. In addition, the mandatory diagnostics must be complete and up to date. If in doubt about the documents to be drawn up by the landlord, seek advice from a local real estate agency.<h2>Finally, don't forget to declare the rent of your property!<\/h2>\nYou have succeeded in renting your apartment or your house which now generates income. Congratulations, your investment has begun to pay off! However, don't forget that your income is subject to<strong>tax<\/strong> and that as such, it is mandatory to declare it in order to comply with the requirements of the tax authorities. The applicable taxation depends on the type of rental. For example, the rents received via a furnished rental are taxed under the BIC regime and not as land income. Renting an apartment or a house requires rigor and a good sense of organization.

It was necessary to broaden their horizons and it was under a joint impulse with the Young Economic Chamber that they created the industrial zone, which has continued to expand over the years.
