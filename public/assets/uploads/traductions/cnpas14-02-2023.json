The omicron form was discovered in South Africa. It has now spread to other nations and immediately led to travel restrictions in the region. On November 8, the U.S. government lifted pandemic-related travel restrictions on dozens of countries. However, the U.S. government reinstated its ban on nationals of eight African countries as of Monday, and the president of the<strong>EU<\/strong> has suggested a halt to air travel between member states and southern Africa. Travelers are advised of the restrictions and possible consequences on travel in the coming days in case of a rapid spread of the omicron strain around the world. The WHO classified it on Friday as a strain of concern.<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-799\" src=\"http:\/\/5s44y58e.cnpas.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/restriction-deplacement.jpeg\" alt=\"restriction deplacement\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\" \/><h2>Does the travel restriction instituted by the U.S. authorities apply to Americans?<\/h2>\nThe ban on African countries does not apply to U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents. However, like anyone entering the U.S. from another country, they must provide confirmation of a negative COVID test in order to board a plane. Although the <strong>U.S. government<\/strong> has not suspended flights to and from the eight affected countries, both the State Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have raised the alert levels for the territory, recommending that travel be avoided.\n\nDue to \"extremely high\" levels of VIDOC, the CDC has issued a Level 4 alert, the highest possible, a level that requires travelers to \"avoid travel.\" The U.S. State Department and its COVID guidance, which often coincides with that of the CDC, also has placed countries in Category 4, which means \"avoid travel.\"<h2>Airlines serving Africa on hold<\/h2>\nDelta and United airlines are the only U.S. domestic carriers operating flights to and from the African continent. Delta Air Lines said the airline, which operates three flights a week between Johannesburg and Atlanta, has no plans to change its schedules at this time. North American travelers who choose to change their flights are not subject to ticket change fees. United recently began service to Johannesburg and Accra and plans to restart service to Cape Town in December. For now, the new omicron variety has little impact on travel, especially for Americans, as Omicron was not discovered until late November. Travel restrictions, however, could quickly become more restrictive as cases and concerns increase. In early 2020, before the pandemic spread, <strong>airlines<\/strong> and the U.S. government focused on coronavirus hotspots, such as Italy at the time, for example. Global travel restrictions were issued a month later, affecting more than 20 countries, and today there is an important distinction that has resulted in the lifting of travel restrictions worldwide. Health experts will conduct a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of the vaccine against the new variant. In addition, travelers should monitor the CDC's travel advisories for any significant changes. For international travel, the CDC currently recommends that travelers from the United States be fully vaccinated.<h2>The new COVID variant will result in a vaccination requirement for domestic flights in the U.S.<\/h2>\nThroughout the outbreak, there have been proposals to impose stricter restrictions on domestic flights (so if you are traveling to the US, plan your trip carefully considering all of these points and feel free to read up on tourism here <a href=\"http:\/\/www.29janvier2009.fr\/\">http:\/\/www.29janvier2009.fr)<\/a>. Initially, the initiative focused on requiring a pre-flight coronavirus test. With the availability of vaccines, attention has shifted to requiring travelers to be vaccinated before boarding a domestic plane. If the omicron form spreads rapidly, calls for a national vaccination requirement for air travelers are likely to persist. Currently, domestic air travelers are not required to show proof of vaccination or official COVID testing, and Hawaii is the only state that requires confirmation of vaccination or a negative COVID test to circumvent the strict quarantine in place upon arrival on the island. Many famous vacation spots outside of the United States also have admission restrictions, and the mandatory mask rule on airplanes is set to expire in January 2022 (but of course will be renewed)."},"translate-1":{"url":"masonry works","title":"What do I need to know about masonry work?","h1":"What are the different types of masonry work?","contenu":"When you plan to renovate (especially for an extension) or to build, it usually involves the intervention of masons. They intervene mainly for the <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\">structural work<\/span> but can also take care of minor <em>repair <\/em>or finishing work.<!--more-->It is thus upstream that you need to understand what masonry consists exactly and how it allows you to embellish your house.<h2>What is masonry?<\/h2>\nMasonry encompasses basic construction and <strong>renovation<\/strong> work. The extent of the work depends on its nature. On the one hand, there is the masonry that ensures the stability of the work and its solidity. We speak of structural work, a set of works that concerns the structural elements. More concretely, this category concerns the earthworks, the realization of the foundations, the creation of the sewage system, the elevation of the interior and exterior walls... On the other hand, you have the second work which refers to the finishing touches. The work is lighter, but this does not mean that it is less complex. Masonry intervenes for example in the installation of partitions and separations, in the smoothing of walls before the application of the finishing coat or in the preparation of the ground which must be homogenized before the installation of the tiling, the parquet floor or any other covering. Within the framework of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnpas.org\/les-bonnes-raisons-de-renover-sa-villa\/\">renovation of villa<\/a> for example, work can consist in the cutting down or the raising of a stone wall, out of bricks, out of concrete... Masonry can also intervene to block openings or to create new ones. The realization of a concrete staircase is also part of the possible works, as well as the replacement of the coatings (installation of facing bricks, for example). Masonry is thus the whole of the interventions which relate directly to the structure of <strong>construction<\/strong> in order to guarantee its longevity.<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-807\" src=\"http:\/\/5s44y58e.cnpas.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/travaux-maconnerie.jpg\" alt=\"travaux maconnerie\" width=\"770\" height=\"513\" \/><h2>Masonry to embellish your house<\/h2>\nMasonry meets a wide range of needs. Although we are talking about embellishment, masons do not focus only on the aesthetic aspect. They also help you identify the work to be done to preserve the stability of the structure so that the renovation and\/or expansion does not affect the longevity of the house.<h3>Masonry work for the interior of a house<\/h3>\nMasonry offers you the opportunity to revise your interior design to suit your lifestyle and preferences. You can hire qualified <strong>masons<\/strong> to partition a large room to create two separate spaces. This is the case when you want to separate your work space (office or mini-workshop) from your bedroom. It is also the case when you want to transform an open kitchen into a closed kitchen or when you want to create an additional room (laundry room, bedroom...) to better exploit the volume of your house. You can also call on the services of masons to decompartmentalize the rooms if you prefer to evolve in an open space. Depending on the case, it may be possible to completely remove interior walls or replace them with partitions that allow natural light to filter through: low walls, glass bricks, clerestory, etc. In the same vein, masonry work allows you to optimize watertightness joints, plug holes and repair cracks on walls and floors. This is without forgetting the<span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"> leveling of concrete<\/span> in order to smooth the surface. The realization of this non-exhaustive work can lead the masons to collaborate with other trades in order to achieve an impeccable finish. It often happens that tilers, electricians, plasterers ... intervene in parallel, always depending on the nature of the work you want to undertake.<h3>Masonry work for the exterior of a house<\/h3>\nThe outside arrangements can induce masonry works of various amplitudes. For example, filling micro cracks around your <strong>exterior woodwork<\/strong> does not require the same level of work as the creation of a low wall that will delimit your property. You can perfectly well call upon craftsmen to restore a concrete slab. You can also use masonry to create and repair a chimney outlet. If the facades are dull and\/or damaged, professional masons can refresh them. This option often avoids the need to plan an early renovation. Still outside, masonry can consist of deconstruction or construction of annexes such as a garden shed, a pergola, etc. Personalized studies must be carried out beforehand so that masons can evaluate the possibilities of<strong>development<\/strong> and embellishment so that aesthetics and solidity go hand in hand.<h2>The different types of masonry work<\/h2>\nWe've discussed many of the possibilities of masonry. However, some types of work deserve to be more detailed as they are frequently required.<h3>Repair of lime rendering<\/h3>\n <em>Lime mortar<\/em> renderings are mainly used on old buildings (dating from before 1948), especially those with stone walls such as limestone or sandstone. These coatings are also used to make cob fillings when the walls are made of wood. Lime coating offers an excellent protection against bad weather and yet, it allows the walls to \"breathe\". Indeed, lime has a homogeneous texture. Since the drying process does not cause shrinkage, there is no risk that the walls will suffer from cracking (also called faien\u00e7age) which would allow the infiltration of water running down the structure. At the same time, lime plaster is microporous. This means that it optimizes water evaporation, which ensures rapid drying. The repair of lime coating is done by pitting. It is a process that preserves the qualities of the building <strong>materials<\/strong> while optimizing the removal of the surface. The craftsmen then use materials of the same nature as those initially used during construction in order to protect the structure against possible pathologies of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnpas.org\/metiers-du-batiment\/\">building<\/a>. The plaster is applied in three layers, the proportion of binder being reduced from the inside to the outside. As it dries, the plaster becomes integrated into the masonry. It thus increases the resistance of the work. We are not only talking about solidity but also resistance to frost and to the numerous climatic variations. Moreover, lime coating is an excellent choice to reinforce <em>the thermal<\/em> and acoustic <em>insulation<\/em> of the <em>house<\/em>. Moreover, lime coating has a grain and a color that give a certain cachet to old houses.<h3>Reworking of stones<\/h3>\nIt is common for ashlars to deteriorate over time. In reality, this is the consequence of external aggressions, of chemical, biological or physical nature. It is therefore necessary to restore ashlars. Masonry offers the choice between repair, reconstruction and replacement depending on the extent of the damage and the characteristics of the stone.<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-808\" src=\"http:\/\/5s44y58e.cnpas.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/maconnerie.jpg\" alt=\"maconnerie\" width=\"1163\" height=\"436\" \/><h2>Why use a masonry professional?<\/h2>\nMasonry work may seem easy, especially when the work is small. However, it is a field that requires specific know-how because the objective is not only to achieve a beautiful result but to ensure the durability of the work over time. The knowledge of the materials and their characteristics, the dexterity in the handling of the tools which must systematically be chosen with care... contribute to the complexity of the masonry. It is thus essential to call upon a masonry company which will take into account all the constraints and will take care to choose the most relevant technique. For my part, I called upon <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techni-murs.com\/\">techni-murs<\/a> for my <strong>masonry work<\/strong>. The team will evaluate all the options to considerably reduce the risks of moisture problems, cracks and other disorders affecting the construction. Masonry work involves both the interior and exterior of the house. Quality work is necessary to ensure that the construction blends in with its environment, lasts over time and that the structural strength of your house is guaranteed."},"translate-2":{"url":"best-choice-ramp-loading-mini-shovel","title":"How to make the right choice for your mini excavator loading ramp?","h1":"Choosing the right loading ramp for your mini excavator","contenu":"<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The versatility of the <b>mini-excavator<\/b> makes it an essential machine on construction sites, regardless of their size.

The mini-excavator can also be used to level a site prior to construction or landscaping, for example. All you have to do is choose the type of bucket that allows you to dig and collect the materials\/waste. This construction equipment is also useful for demolition since it is able to pick up rubble quickly.<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Simply put, it is the attachments attached to the articulated arm that define the possible uses of a mini excavator.<\/p>\n\n<h3><span class=\"Titre3Car\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;\">Definition: loading ramp<\/span><\/span><\/h3>\nThe loading ramp is an inclined plane that is used to facilitate loading on a platform (truck, container...) or the passage between different levels of land. The vehicle or<b>machine<\/b> must be equipped with wheels or tracks to be able to pass on the ramp. The ramp avoids having to lift or push heavy loads that have to be moved to a higher level than the ground.<h3><span class=\"Titre3Car\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;\">What is the purpose of a mini excavator loading ramp?<\/span><\/span><\/h3>\nAs its name indicates, this type of ramp is designed for loading and unloading mini excavators. The operation is carried out in complete safety since the <b>construction<\/b> machine moves by rolling on the ramp (or pair of ramps), the engine being switched off only once the machine has been positioned on the platform or after it has carried out the required work on the elevated ground. This type of equipment can be used for <a href=\"https:\/\/5s44y58e.cnpas.org\/travaux-maconnerie\/\">masonry work<\/a>, for example.<h2><span class=\"Titre2Car\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;\">How do I choose a mini-excavator loading ramp?<\/span><\/span><\/h2>\nMany factors must be considered when choosing a loading ramp because you must ensure that the operations do not damage either the ramp or the material to be loaded\/unloaded during handling.<h3><span class=\"Titre3Car\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;\">\nDepending on the size of the machine<\/span><\/span><\/h3>\nIt is imperative that you note the dimensions of the mini excavator in order to determine the dimensions of the ramp or pair of ramps.

There you will find all the important information about the size of the machine and thus the ideal dimensions of the loading ramp. Good to know: In the case of a mini tracked excavator, the number of links has no influence on the choice of the right ramp.<h3><span class=\"Titre3Car\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;\">Depending on the weight of the machine<\/span><\/span><\/h3>\nLike their dimensions, the weights of mini excavators are not the same. Some machines weigh around 800 kg while others can reach 7 tons. It is therefore essential to consider the weight when selecting a boom. The goal is to make sure that the boom in question is strong enough to support the mini excavator. Ideally, you should allow for a margin in the load capacity of the ramp. This is particularly useful if you have to load a mini-excavator with a <b>bucket<\/b> full of rubble or materials, for example.<h3>Depending on the loading height<\/h3>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The loading height is essential in the choice of loading ramps.

George Ravenscroft, an English merchant specializing in glass, had the idea of adding a high proportion of lead to the glass recipe to make it stronger. In France, it was in the 18th century, under Louis XVI, that Fran\u00e7ois de Beaufort invented a formula with 35% lead. From this crystal factory, several others were set up on French territory, including the famous Baccarat factory of which Napoleon III was so fond. Crystal is a glass of exceptional finesse and luminosity, which is what makes it so beautiful. In addition to <strong>glass crystal<\/strong>, there is rock crystal, which has been known and used since antiquity. It is the subject of many jewelry and sculptures. It is a variety of extremely hard quartz, of such fineness and transparency that it is similar to a precious stone. <strong>Rock crystal<\/strong> is still widely used in art decoration.<h2>The traditional manufacture of crystal<\/h2>\nTo make crystal, it is necessary to arm oneself with the basic recipe of glass, with a high density of silica, a white sand as pure as possible, to which one adds, traditionally of the ash of fern for a contribution of potassium. The addition of lead is done at the end. It lowers the temperature of fusion of the glass, to bring solidity and brightness to the material thus created.

The picker will catch the molten crystal with a cane and make a ball. He must remove all air bubbles from the ball before delivering it to the blower. In the traditional craft, the blower blows into the cane and quickly plugs the hole to avoid the return of the broth. When the first air bubble has formed, the blower's role is to blow the crystal continuously to create a fine and regular object. When the crystal has cooled down, it is the sculptor's job to make his work for a <strong>handcrafted crystal<\/strong>.<h2>A decoration with crystal chandeliers<\/h2>\nDecorating an interior with crystal chandeliers gives your home transparency and light.

It allows the lessor to determine the viability of a real estate project and if he should invest in it. This is why <em>calculating the profitability of a property<\/em> allows one to measure the income that can be derived from it. The latter is derived from the rental in relation to its acquisition price. When the ratio is high, it means that the property is profitable. It is thus a calculation that must be done with great care and detail to know <em>the interest of a particular investment<\/em>. However, the calculation of the rental profitability can take into account several important criteria. And there are three ways to do it. When you buy a property, you should always <strong>calculate the gross profitability<\/strong> of the property. This is the first necessary information you need, but when trying to really determine the rental yield, there are a few important things to consider. For example:<ul>\n \t<li>rent;<\/li>\n \t<li>the taxation;<\/li>\n \t<li>expenses;<\/li>\n \t<li>and the purchase price.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nThe gross profitability<strong>,<\/strong> on the other hand, is useful when you do the research. It allows you to determine and compare properties against each other. It only takes into consideration the annual rent and the price of the property. For example, the rent excluding charges \u00d7 12 months\/the purchase price. When you want to buy a studio for \u20ac100,000, and it is rented for \u20ac500 per month, here is how to <strong>calculate the gross profitability <\/strong>: (500 \u00d7 12) \u00f7 100000 = 6%.<h2>Simulate the net return on a rental investment<\/h2>\nThe gross return is a good approximation that allows you to compare homes and their interest. However, the reality of the return on your investment must include many other criteria. In order to have access to more precise indicators, in the context of your real estate project, you must include other important points. For example, we cite:<ul>\n \t<li>property tax ;<\/li>\n \t<li>non-recoverable co-ownership charges<\/li>\n \t<li>the owner's insurance;<\/li>\n \t<li>management fees.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nIn the example we cited above, the <strong>gross yield was a percentage<\/strong> of 6%. But when you add the expenses, you will see that this figure will quickly rise. In addition, the taxation of landed income on the progressive tax scale is 17.2%. And so, calculating the net profitability will prepare you to write a real estate plan and a precise financial strategy. If you have no idea of the amount of expenses, you can <strong>estimate the rental return <\/strong>by reducing 3 months of rent. This is the usual estimate of the amount of annual expenses. Of course, only if you manage your property yourself. For example: (500 \u20ac \u00d7 9 months)\/ 100000 \u20ac and thus 4,5 %.<h2>How to optimize the simulation of the rental yield in real estate ?<\/h2>\nTo simulate the expenses is crucial for an investor, for him, it is the means of palpating indirectly the financial expenses which it will have. Several solutions are at your disposal in order to improve the rental yield of a property, you can simulate the use of tax devices or credits. When we talk about tax incentives, they allow you to optimize your tax system and obtain much more beneficial returns. For example, you can use options such as the Pinel device which is an excellent solution to obtain reductions of up to 63,000 \u20ac over 12 years without any conditions. In return, you will simply have to commit to renting the property for a <strong>period of 6, 9 or 12<\/strong> years. You must also acquire the property in a specific area, which makes the simulation even more important because prices vary from one area to another. But also to respect the ceilings of resources which are<a href=\"https:\/\/5s44y58e.cnpas.org\/la-loi-pinel-et-son-influence\/\"> imposed by the Pinel law<\/a>. In short, the simulation is an extremely important tool that will help you infinitely in your rental investment. To succeed in your project, we strongly advise you to use it before investing."},"translate-11":{"url":"agence-gestion-locative","title":"Rental management agency : what are the criteria of choice ?","h1":"How to choose a rental management agency?","contenu":"The management of a rental property can be very complicated in some cases.

In order to understand this management, we present you some advices to follow.<h3>Set the rent amount<\/h3>\nThe first thing to do is to estimate the amount of rent to present to the tenants. It must be chosen in such a way that it can cover the expenses, taxes, loans... A high rent allows a very important return on investment, a low rent attracts more tenants and offers a positive impact. It is therefore necessary to choose the rent carefully and to determine in part how you wish to manage your property.<h3>Finding a tenant<\/h3>\nOnce the rent has been set, you must now look for a tenant in two ways. You can either do the search yourself or hire a professional to find a tenant, sort the files and do the visits.<h3>Signing the lease<\/h3>\n<strong>The lease contract<\/strong> is drawn up in duplicate by the lessor and signed by both parties. It contains all the obligatory and optional clauses concerning the lease, notably<ul>\n \t<li>the name and address of the tenant and the owner ;<\/li>\n \t<li>the address of the accommodation;<\/li>\n \t<li>the description of the unit;<\/li>\n \t<li>the duration of the lease;<\/li>\n \t<li>the inventory of fixtures of the dwelling;<\/li>\n \t<li>the amount of rent;<\/li>\n \t<li>the surface area of the dwelling.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nAfter that, the owner <strong>must subscribe to certain insurances<\/strong>, notably the home insurance, the unpaid rent insurance and the non-occupant insurance.<h3>Renting the property<\/h3>\nAs soon as the tenant moves in, he\/she is responsible for paying the receipts and presenting them to the landlord upon request. On the anniversary of the signing of the<strong> rental agreement<\/strong>, the landlord can increase the rent, but this action must be mentioned in the contract. Thus, the tenant must pay certain expenses, including those related to services related to the dwelling, maintenance and repairs of the dwelling, taxes that correspond to the services that the tenant enjoys...<h3>The end of the lease<\/h3>\nAt the end of the lease, the owner must <em>make an inventory of fixtures of exit<\/em>, and a statement of accounts in order to compare with the inventory of fixtures of entry.<h2>Advantages of the rental management for a private individual<\/h2>\nMany people prefer to <strong>manage their rental property themselves<\/strong> in order to benefit from several savings, in fact calling upon an agency to take care of the rental management, makes you pay between 7 and 10 % of the rents excluding taxes. By carrying out the rental management oneself, one takes care of the administrative, legal and technical tasks, thus no cost related to an agency, which allows a better return.

Here are the main reasons why it makes sense to allocate a budget for event security: - Optimal VIP management: When hosting a crowd that includes popular people, it is possible that the event will attract unwanted attention from disruptive people. - Experience in managing large crowds: Even a large, docile crowd can become unmanageable without experience. For example, professionally qualified security guards can help you control the flow of crowds. - Keeping the venue safe: Security guards can provide care, clear a path through the crowd, etc. Thus, during an event receiving the public, the security guard ensures the safety of people, but also the protection of property [caption id=\"attachment_1404\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"https:\/\/5s44y58e.cnpas.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/3.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-1404\" src=\"https:\/\/5s44y58e.cnpas.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/3.jpg\" alt=\"Trois agents de s\u00e9curit\u00e9\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/><\/a> Security agents to ensure the event[\/caption]<h2>\n\n\nSecurity adapted to the event<\/h2>\nDepending on the type of event to be secured, it is necessary to choose the type of event security, in order to choose the right <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forteressesecuriteprivee.com\/fr\/\">private security agency<\/a>. Indeed, to each event corresponds a type of event security with its own particularities. Thus, we have the private security of events: - Sports: Clearly one of the most risky events with the possibility of tens of thousands of people, alcohol and often rival teams. Professionally qualified security guards are needed to ensure the safety of the people present on the field, notably through remote surveillance. Corporate: Even if incidents are rare, they do exist. The participants of<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnpas.org\/les-evenements-dentreprise\/\"> corporate events<\/a> are usually wealthy, which can be a source of trouble and therefore requires reinforced security. In addition, the use of security companies reinforces the brand image of the structure. In some cases, this type of event may involve the exclusive sharing of intellectual property, which means that strict guest lists are mandatory and must be closely monitored to prevent intrusion by those with malicious intent.\n- Personal: Whether it's a wedding, birthday or anniversary party, depending on the size of the event, the need for event security companies becomes more important - Concerts: heavy intoxication is common at this type of event and the risk of disturbances is high. The tasks of security guards are important and varied. They may have to rescue seriously injured people, prevent the intrusion of weapons and dangerous objects at the entry points, etc.<h2>\n\nCall in the pros!<\/h2>\nWhen you want to hire a private security company, whether it is for guarding, you need to make sure that the agents are qualified, experienced and accredited for the type of event you are planning. The first step before hiring a professional security company is to audit the premises where the event will take place. This will identify entry and exit points, as well as potential weak points that need to be reinforced. Security companies can help you improve this step. The second step is to estimate the number of participants. At this point, you can start searching through the security companies available online. Security and guarding companies should have experience in managing event security. They should also have a business card for each officer and all the necessary licenses to ensure the success of your event. Security agencies make sure their agents are responsive before granting them a business card. In the world of events, calling upon a security company, experienced in remote surveillance, is essential to ensure the protection of property and especially people."},"translate-19":{"url":"which-neighborhood-to-live-antibes","title":"Antibes : the districts where it is good to live","h1":"In which district to live in Antibes ?","contenu":"A seaside town nestled on the French Riviera, Antibes is a Provencal jewel that attracts a growing number of newcomers.

It is mainly appreciated for its historical charm. If you want to discover Antibes and, more broadly, the Alpes Maritimes, from an authentic angle, this area is for you. The <strong>Provencal market<\/strong> is a nugget for anyone looking for fresh local products. Some traditional preparations are sold there to make you discover the typical flavors of the region, but also to inspire you in your gourmet creations. The city center also houses interesting museums that you will find hard to get tired of. This is the case of the famous <em>Picasso museum<\/em> which is located a few steps away from the museum of arts and popular traditions. If you want to go further in historical discoveries, don't miss the archaeology museum. Covered with white sand, the beach of La Gravette is lined with medieval walls that add to the charm of the city center.<h3>The Cap d'Antibes<\/h3>\nCap d'Antibes is where you will find the majority of <strong>luxury<\/strong> villas and properties. Top floor apartments with a terrace overlooking the beach, villas surrounded by a private wooded park, 19th century mansions, the Cap d'Antibes real estate portfolio is a credit to its prestige. The omnipresence of nature is also a major asset. Pines and eucalyptus trees are particularly numerous. In addition to the surf, it is common to hear the song of cicadas and birds while enjoying a breath of oxygen. It should be noted that the price of real estate is quite high in this area considered as one of the most luxurious of the city and the Alpes Maritimes in general. Nevertheless, the purchase price is compensated by the living environment which will give you the impression of being on vacation all year long.<h3>The old town<\/h3>\nThe Old Town is fascinating with its 16th century ramparts, its ancient gates that link the city to its past and its resolutely modern yachts that come and go in the Vauban marina. The <strong>Fort Carr\u00e9<\/strong> is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful historical jewels of the Old Town. Built to protect the city against the incursion of the Dukes of Savoy, it has undergone a refurbishment following the directives of Louis XIV. The defensive architecture contrasts with the abundance of vegetation all around the fort. The <em>Saint-Bernardin<\/em> chapel, which also dates from the 16th century, is also part of the local heritage. Don't hesitate to visit it to marvel at its artistically crafted ceiling, its altar decorated with acanthus leaves or the walls decorated with motifs that force admiration. The cobbled streets of the old town and the shops that abound will also seduce you. Antibes is a magnificent seaside resort where life is good.

This allows you to benefit from a report of the regular deadlines without wasting time. Secondly, you are not able to master all the <strong>formal aspects related to rental management<\/strong>. For example, you have difficulty with :<ul>\n \t<li>the analysis of rental files,<\/li>\n \t<li>entry and exit formalities,<\/li>\n \t<li>landlord-tenant relations.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nThat's why sometimes it's better to outsource these tasks if you don't have the time or don't think you have the skills. You may also simply not be familiar with the process and not want to make a mistake. Investors choose to <strong>delegate their rental management<\/strong> so that it is done properly. Another reason is that you are looking for a serene and rigorous management and you do not feel capable of it. Real estate agencies offer services in this sense and usually have standard documents with legal expertise. Finally<strong>,<\/strong>if you have too many rental properties and you cannot manage them, you should be able to use the following services The rental receipts on the same model and the organization of the reports will make your life easier. That's why property management in one company or in the hands of one person is ideal.<h2>What are the services of a rental management?<\/h2>\n <strong>Rental management offers <\/strong>are all different, however, specific services will always be included. For example, the search for the tenant, the analysis of the files and the administrative steps, the setting in hiring, the collection of the rents, the revival, if there are unpaid. But also the follow-up and the management of the repairs, the relations with the syndic, the insurances and the necessary details. As far as the rental management fees are concerned, they always correspond to the percentage of the receipts. These are always made through the rental management, which recovers the rents and rental charges. The fees are collected by the manager before paying <strong>the sums due to the owner<\/strong>.<h2>What are the rental management fees ?<\/h2>\nA study conducted by the Homepilot platform on the level of more than 450 real estate agencies has determined that the<strong> rental management fees<\/strong> are 10.2% of the collections. A part: 7,5 %, represents the long term rental management costs, and 2,7 % represents the renting. It is assumed that the tenant changes every 3 years on average. When the tenant is replaced by another, the change has an effect on the landlord. Thus, the costs of the<strong> real estate agency fees <\/strong>are often shared between the tenant and the landlord. A visit to the property, for example, or the creation of the file, are paid for by the latter. We take into consideration the rates charged by <em>the rental management agency<\/em>, it depends in particular on the pricing policy of the agency. But not only that, other important points come into play: for example, the geographical location alone can make the rate double. From 6.3% to 13.1% in some collections. And this only applies to the Paris area. However, you should also know that the opportunities in Paris are much more varied. Another point to keep in mind is: the <em>rental fees<\/em><strong>, <\/strong>which can be very expensive in certain situations. The rental profitability changes according to these points, which is why it is important to have an attractive rental property and strategic management. Potentially, the costs of renting the property can sometimes be very heavy for the owner. It is thus important to think about a guarantee of unpaid rent, the insurance can cost up to 2.5% of the receipts. However, its protection, in relation to the owner and the unpaid rents, is crucial. You can also purchase a home warranty insurance from some real estate agencies."},"translate-21":{"url":"gestion-locative-ligne","title":"Online rental management: what are the advantages?","h1":"How to use online rental management?","contenu":"Did you know that nowadays there is <strong>online rental management software <\/strong>that can be used by individual landlords?
