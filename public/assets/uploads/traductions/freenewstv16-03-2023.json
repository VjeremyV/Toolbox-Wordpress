And for all those who hate the thick nails that gel and resin can make us, with semi-permanent nail polish the appearance will be that of a classic nail polish! Semi-permanent nail polish is more than a nail polish, it is an acrylic gel with color pigments incorporated. It is applied like a classic varnish but only dries under UV lamps which allows the material to harden and to be fixed for two to three weeks.<h3>How does it work?<\/h3>\n[caption id=\"attachment_37\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1280\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/ekr39ogz.freenewstv.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/Ongles.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-37\" src=\"http:\/\/ekr39ogz.freenewstv.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/Ongles.jpg\" alt=\"Avant la pose du vernis, une bonne manucure est importante pour pr\u00e9parer vos ongles.\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" \/><\/a> Before applying the nail polish, a good manicure is important to prepare your nails. You can do it at home, in fact, many brands such as OPI or Peggy Sage offer complete kits to allow you to apply your semi-permanent nail polish yourself. You can also have it applied in an institute by professionals where you will find international brands such as SHELLAC. In all cases the technique remains the same: it is applied in 4 layers, a base, two layers of varnish and one of top coat. After each application you spend 2 minutes under a UV lamp to catalyze it and 30 seconds under an LED lamp. Before that don't forget to do your basic manicure: file, push back the cuticles, polish. In an institute, the professional will do this before any application. At home, don't forget this step if not the nail polish will not last as long as expected! A significant advantage is that the application does not require any sanding of the nail, which avoids many attacks that will weaken it.<h2>And to remove it?<\/h2>\nTwo to three weeks after the application, when the nail has grown back and an unsightly demarcation starts to appear, you remove your nail polish by putting your fingers in cotton pads soaked in nail polish remover with acetone and then wrapped in aluminum foil. Removal in 6 minutes, watch in hand...

You will find it on many sites like \"Direct Matelas\" for example. Choose natural fiber mattresses that allow air to pass through. A memory foam mattress with a matching pillow will fit your body perfectly, avoid bad positions and envelop your limbs. The spring mattress is still the ultimate mattress: the new springs are \"pocketed\" and have no rebound effect. The support of the spring mattress is very good and firm. <strong>Choosing the right bedding<\/strong> is a good step towards a better sleep.<\/p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">The rules for a good night's sleep<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A healthy lifestyle must be respected if you want to sleep well and return to the arms of Morpheus in a serene manner. It is also preferable to avoid naps and to stop using the computer at least 1.5 hours before going to sleep. You should not continue working in bed or eating in bed: the <strong>bed <\/strong>is the space reserved for sleep. The temperature should not be too low or too high. Air conditioning can alter<em> sleep <\/em>and worse, you can catch a cold! If it is between 18 and 20 degrees, it is perfect!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The consumption of tea and coffee is also to be avoided because they contain theine and caffeine, powerful exciters that will keep you awake! No alcohol either, so as not to disturb your sleep. Cigarettes can also, depending on the person, act as a stimulant or depressant. You should also not play sports in the evening two hours before going to bed. Don't overeat: digesting a heavy meal can cause restless sleep, as can skipping dinner. Eat sparingly, prepare a light meal! My advice: drink a cup of warm milk with vanilla sugar before bedtime because it contains the melatonin needed to regulate your sleep. An infusion can also be the solution. And why not a<a href=\"http:\/\/ekr39ogz.freenewstv.fr\/un-week-end-entre-filles-sur-la-cote-dazur\/\"> weekend with the girls on the<\/a> French Riviera to relax?<\/p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">The causes of insomnia can also be psychological<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Stress or anxiety can also be the cause of your insomnia! It is also important not to disturb your sleep rhythm. If you start yawning, don't fight it: go to bed! Forcing yourself to keep your eyes open to work on your file for the next day or to watch the end of your favorite series can upset everything: you then run the risk of not being able to sleep at all!  We also avoid heated or stressful discussions, horror movies, etc.! Anything that could spoil your sleep. Think about something else: insomnia is often in your head. The more you think you won't be able to sleep, the more you get stuck! You can also try self-hypnosis techniques to get to sleep.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And you, do you have <strong>anti-insomnia<\/strong> tips?<\/p>"},"translate-8":{"url":"le-top-3-des-robes-glamour-pour-un-mariage","title":"Choosing a glamorous outfit to go to a wedding","h1":"The top 3 glamorous dresses for a wedding","contenu":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">During a wedding, the beauty queen must of course be the bride, but that doesn't stop you from being beautiful!

The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nicebonbon.com\/shop\/?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">consumption of confectionery<\/a> should not, however, be excessive, as the <strong>sugars contained in these foods<\/strong> can be dangerous at high levels.

All sugar-free sweets, though, consist mainly of a formula derived from maltitol or aspartame (substitutes for <strong>sucrose sugar<\/strong>), as well as several flavourings that serve to achieve the desired taste.<\/p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lozenges<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lozenges originally contained food supplements intended for patients suffering from excess weight or diabetes<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Diabetes_mellitus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(read more<\/a>).

Developed according to the desired flavours, they feature a less sugary taste than classic fruity sweets. Moreover, apart from flavouring agents, the majority of sweets on the market are made up of natural calorie-free sweeteners.

The term \"sugar alcohols\" is an abuse of language. In fact, contrary to their name, these components contain neither sugar nor alcohol. Their main advantage lies in their low calorie count. Moreover, \"sugar alcohols\" are not metabolised by the body and so have no effect on metabolism or glycaemia (the amount of sugar in the blood). Nutritionists therefore advise diabetics and overweight persons to consume sugar-free sweets in moderation.<\/p>\nTo substitute for natural sugar, the manufacturers of sugar-free confectionery have opted for <strong>maltitol, xylitol or aspartame<\/strong>. Normally present in syrups, maltitol is a starch-based sweetener noted for having little effect on the teeth. Xylitol, on the other hand, is a component derived from birchbark. It is found to be lower in calories and glycaemic value and also poses no danger to dental health. Whatever its components, sugar-free confectionery tastes just as sweet as its traditional counterpart.<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It does, however, differ in having <strong>fewer calories<\/strong> and little effect on nutritional balance. There is also certain sugar-free confectionery containing isomalt, which has proved lower in calories and sugar than the classic ingredients of sweets.

This allows you to preserve the aesthetics of your front door, especially if you are a tenant in your home or in a condominium. A wide variety of doors and systems can be equipped, from the inside to the outside: entrance doors, but also interior doors, service doors and other gates.

There are a number of different models to choose from depending on your security needs: there are both <strong>single-point<\/strong> and <strong>multi-point<\/strong> mortise lock systems. The multipoint systems are more secure and therefore more resistant to <strong>burglaries<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before you start <strong>changing<\/strong> or installing your security system for your front door, make sure you have correctly identified the direction in <strong>which your lock is installed<\/strong>. If the hinges or \" <strong>hinge<\/strong> \" are on the left, then your lock is on the right and vice versa. Note that most mortise locks are now manufactured with a reversible <strong>latch<\/strong>. This allows the lock to be installed on either the right or left side.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Afterwards, plan to spare some time and gather all the materials and tools you will need. These usually include: a flathead \/ Phillips screwdriver, a hammer and a can of lubricant.<\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">All the steps of a mortise lock replacement<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Several steps to be carried out in order are necessary to properly change a mortise lock. First, you will have to unscrew both the inner casing, as well as the handle plates at the front and back of the door. Remember that what holds the box inside the door are the handle mounting screws! Next, remove the plates on the front and back, the handle, and the metal rod. Unscrew, then unhinge the lock assembly by gently pulling from the inside with your screwdriver.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then, to properly fit the new lock into the housing, use a hammer or ideally a rubber mallet. Tighten the screws that secure the lock block to the door jamb. You will then need to insert the handle into the initial hole in the door and assemble the front and back plates at the same time. Tighten the mounting screws one last time and test the assembly for proper operation, ideally with a spray lubricant at the latch.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Depending on the nature of your installation and the degree of<strong>urgency<\/strong>, don't hesitate to call a professional <strong>locksmith<\/strong> installer near you at any time.

At that time, the people knew how to elaborate a very appreciated sweetness because sweetened but they kept jealously the secret of manufacture of it. It was not until the 4th century BC that the first honey was made. At that time, Alexander the Great brought back from his trip to this distant land, one of these famous \"reeds with honey without the bees having intervened to make it\". From then on, this pure delight was so appreciated that it spread little by little around the Mediterranean. We are at the beginning of the making of these first sweets that are candies. It is then necessary to wait for the XIIth century and the time of the crusades so that Europe discovers what is the sugar cane. <strong>The confectionery<\/strong> appears everywhere in the old Europe. At that time, sugar was used as a remedy. The apothecaries of the time got rich with it because they sold it at a high price. At the same time, marmalades and the first candied fruits appeared. They are considered as a luxury confectionery because they are also traded for fortunes. However, the sugar trade was not organized until the end of the 16th century in Europe. The confectionery takes then much more importance and numerous recipes are born. When the popes in Avignon settle down in the palace, the birth of the dragees, the pralines and the nougats appears. These sweets are called <strong>drageteries<\/strong> or room spices. It is customary for hosts to offer them to their guests at the end of the meal. The occasions to offer sweets took on a real sense of propriety and it was very fashionable to offer them to one's acquaintances. The following century saw the appearance of marrons glac\u00e9s and pastilles of all kinds. In France, some confectioners opened stores in the capital. The rich bourgeois and nobles went there regularly. Beet sugar appeared in the 19th century. Thanks to him, the confectionery is democratized. Since this century, the confectioners did not have of cease to create <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nicebonbon.com\/\">candies<\/a> of all kinds, of all colors made up of various tastes and for all the purses.

This is the basic formula for estimating how much your pension will be.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But you should know that the full rate (50%) is not automatically earned. This is where the number of effective years of work comes into play. The number of quarters contributed plays a decisive role in the calculation of your pension. For example, employees born in 1950 must have at least 162 quarters of regular contributions, while those born in 1973 or later must have contributed a minimum of 172 quarters.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Obviously, stable employment is the best way to validate these quarters. However, military service, sick leave and parental leave, and periods of unemployment may be eligible for validation.<\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">The family situation is taken into account in the calculation of your retirement<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">8 free quarters per child are awarded to mothers who gave birth or legally adopted children before January 1, 2010. If the children were born or adopted on or after January 1, 2010, the mother is entitled to 4 quarters assimilated to maternity. In the case of an adopted child, 4 quarters are also validated as foster care or education. The parents may share these free quarters but they must inform the pension fund of their decision no later than 6 months after the fourth birthday of the child concerned. Otherwise, the free quarters are automatically attributed to the mother of the family, i.e. 8.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Still related to the family situation, a bonus called child increase of 10% is granted to workers who have raised 3 or more children. This provision also applies to those who have raised and thus had to support at least 3 children over a period of 9 years before their sixteenth birthday.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If the parents do not receive the same<strong> salary<\/strong>, it is more interesting to grant the bonuses to the parent with the higher income.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another possible case: you have taken on the permanent care of a disabled adult who is a member of your family.

The calculation of the amount you will receive will take into account the number of points you have acquired, the value of the point (determined by decree each year) and the rate of settlement you have obtained according to your length of contributions as previously mentioned in the section on calculating the basic social security pension.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the case of farm managers, the basic <strong>pension<\/strong> is flat-rate if the activity constitutes your main source of income.

Before you embark on such an undertaking without some prior knowledge, we suggest you take a moment to review the characteristics and benefits of dietary supplements during a period of <strong>nutritional rebalancing<\/strong>... You will discover the main characteristics and major benefits of these products, and you will learn to better define the supplements you need for your diet or your health cure ...<!--more--><h2>What is a diet supplement?<\/h2>\nA dietary supplement - also known as a \"nutritional supplement\" - aims to provide additional nutrients to a slimming program, in order to compensate for certain deficiencies. In concrete terms, and since the Framework Directive on Food Supplements defined in 2002, food supplements \"act as real foodstuffs helping to constitute a concentrated source of nutrients and substances when supplementing a normal diet\". Their effects are multiple, whether they are alone or in combination with other products. Food supplements are therefore products halfway between food and medicine, which can help prevent or compensate for certain deficiencies in the body. Even better: if they can effectively prepare for a diet, they also help fight against fatigue and stress. Be careful, however, food supplements are not intended to replace a medical treatment, and they have no effect on certain diseases or certain pathological developments related to a particular deficiency - we think in particular of all diseases related to a problem of <em>vitamin C<\/em> intake, for example.<h2>Slimming food supplements: for whom?<\/h2>\nFood supplements can be used throughout life and in many cases. They are not specifically advised against for a category of population according to the age. These products rich in essential nutrients can be used to promote growth in children. For people who have a particular diet and \/ or who are subject to a specific diet, supplements can be interesting. This is the case, for example, for pregnant women, who need to take a more thorough look at their diet during this period of their lives. Food supplements are also used to strengthen the immune system, when <strong>deficiencies <\/strong>are detected in adults for example. Certain zinc-rich products are particularly recommended for revitalizing the skin and hair system. However, the average daily dose of 40 to 50 mg should not be exceeded to avoid damaging the body.<h2>Slimming food supplements to lose weight<\/h2>\nNatural food supplements are also used to <strong>lose weight<\/strong>! If you are looking to lose weight quickly without putting yourself in danger and by respecting a few daily rules, you should know that nutritional supplements can be of great help. To avoid disappointments with unhealthy products, you should choose food supplements that use the essential properties of plants to the maximum. Thus, some specialists in phytotherapy regularly develop 100% natural capsules, with essential oils and other active ingredients. You will thus have access to the right dosage, with products that meet French and European GMP standards in every respect and with a pharmaceutical quality result. Among the most popular natural supplements, we note the existence of spirulina, rich in nutrients. Vegetarians or vegans are familiar with this product, which provides a <em>protein <\/em>supplement frequently found in red meat or eggs. Chlorella, which is a soft seaweed, also contains many nutrients whose active ingredients can effectively fight against weight gain. It also contributes to the efficient elimination of toxins and heavy metals from the body. Among the qualitative nutritional elements that are easily found in nature and which are the basis of naturopathic practices, let's also mention the assets of garcinia cambogia. The food supplements designed from this fruit peel extract can achieve a very effective result in weight loss.<h2>Food supplements slimming associated with a rebalancing diet<\/h2>\nAs we had the opportunity to mention above, food supplements are not intended to replace a medical treatment, and even less to a balanced diet. It is therefore necessary to combine nutritional supplements and daily calories at every moment through an appropriate program. This means that your treatment must be coherent, to avoid, for example, unbalancing your ratios: this is what is called the RDA - or recommended nutritional intake. For example, if you consume a lot of starchy or sweet products, you could quickly face a vitamin B1 deficiency. Some natural food supplements can provide you with what you need at this level, with adapted doses ranging from 2.2 to 2.4 mg per day. Do you have skin problems or inflammation? You may be facing a zinc deficiency. You should know that the recommended nutritional intake ranges from 8 to 10 mg per day for an adult. For pregnant women, this level increases rapidly to 11 mg per day. As we have seen throughout this publication, nutritional supplements play a key role in our health and in maintaining our immune resources. Even if most of the proteins we need on a daily basis can be found in red meat, fish or certain cereals, our behavior and our lifestyle can work against us. This is why it is important to be able to rely on nutritional supplements designed and developed by true specialists in phytotherapy based on the natural properties of plants.

The ascendant, as you will see in the following lines, is an elementary data that allows us to better draw your birth chart.<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-593\" src=\"http:\/\/ekr39ogz.freenewstv.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/signe-astrologie-ascendant.jpg\" alt=\"signe astrologie ascendant\" width=\"958\" height=\"720\" \/><h2>What is an ascendant?<\/h2>\nEveryone knows his or her <strong>astrological sign<\/strong>: it is an elementary data that we receive at birth, and which refers directly to the 12 astrological signs of the zodiac. But you may be less aware of the influence of your ascendant on the sign that was given to you. Thus, if the \"sun\" sign represents your ego (i.e. your fundamental concerns), the ascendant reveals more sensitive parts of your personality, in relation to what you exude or what those around you perceive of you. Never neglect this fact, because it also greatly influences the way you behave in society! This is especially true since your ascendant tends to become more important as you mature and get older. To accurately determine your ascendant, a psychic professional will use not only your date of birth, but also the time and place. Other astrological tools such as an <em>atlas<\/em> and a house table will help refine the search.<h2>The ascendant tells us more about our qualities and faults<\/h2>\nIt's a fact: your whole life is governed by the sign that was assigned to you at the time of your sign, and by the influence of your astrological ascendant which governs every single one of your emotions. For example, if the sign of Leo is known to be particularly loyal and compatible with other signs such as Aries, the place and time of your birth can bring a particular sensitivity to your profile and determine certain characteristics inherent in your personality. If you are interested in learning more about this subject, don't hesitate to contact a clairvoyant professional who will be able to decipher for you the sensitive origins of your birth chart.<h2>The ascendant allows us to know the essence of our personality<\/h2>\nKnow this: your personality is unique and defines who you are in relation to others. No two people react in the same way to the same events, which is why it may be important for you to learn more about what governs your psychic identity. Your astrological <strong>ascendant <\/strong>is one of the elements that can help you learn more about your personality and what awaits you in the near future. Keep in mind that your ascendant will be like a compass for you throughout your life, and will allow you to see more clearly as you move through the successive stages of life. The ascendant not only reveals our deepest personality, but also gives us the possibility to pay more attention to our direct social environment. It is thus a question of knowing how to play with it on a daily basis, in order to better advance and know how to live in society. In any case, you should know that your ascendant refers to the sign that rose on the Eastern horizon at the time of your birth. It is therefore likely to reveal certain parts of your inner self to those around you.<h2>The ascendant allows you to complete your natal chart<\/h2>\nWould you like to know what your <strong>natal chart<\/strong> has in store for you, in relation to your ascendant? To use a metaphor, you should know that these two elements are like a photograph of the sky at the time of your birth. When you know your ascendant, you are able to have a complete individual astral vision and to better understand what the future holds for you. When you know your astral chart linked to your ascendant, you automatically obtain fundamental astrological data, allowing you to explain a certain number of phenomena: your shortcomings, your faults, as well as all the problems that you face in your daily life can be explained by the influence of your ascendant.<strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cabinet-kld-voyance.fr\/astrologie-ascendant.html\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-592\" src=\"http:\/\/ekr39ogz.freenewstv.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/ascendant-astrologie.jpg\" alt=\"ascendant astrologie\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" \/><\/a><\/strong>\n\n\nWe have just reviewed a number of elements related to your natal chart.

In <em>Portugal<\/em>, Laos, Madagascar and Algeria, tipping is appreciated but not mandatory. It corresponds to 5-10% of the <strong>bill<\/strong> and means that you are satisfied with the quality of service in the restaurant. In Indonesia, the tip is mostly given to porters. If you go to Hungary, Egypt, Palestine or Dubai, plan on a 10% tip on top of the bill (cab, restaurant...). Remember to check that this extra is not already included in the bill. In Hungary, it is customary to verbally announce the amount of the tip, which is then added to the bill. Never leave money on the table, it is not appreciated. Tipping is almost indispensable in Cuba. It is offered to <strong>baggage handlers<\/strong>, <strong>cab<\/strong> drivers, chambermaids, <strong>waiters<\/strong>... In England, North America and Austria, it is mandatory to leave between 10 and 15% of the bill as a tip. In Japan, on the other hand, tipping is considered an insult. As you can see, it is not easy to decide whether or not to leave an extra tip. It is best to find out in advance if you are planning to travel. This will help you avoid making mistakes.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.roidutablier.com\/12-vetements-de-service-hotellerie\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-605\" src=\"http:\/\/ekr39ogz.freenewstv.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/serveuse.jpg\" alt=\"serveuse\" width=\"615\" height=\"615\" \/><\/a>\n<h2>\nArguments in favor of a mandatory tip<\/h2>\nTipping is often a personal <strong>gratuity<\/strong> whose amount is left to the discretion of the customer. According to some tourism professionals, it is a lever to motivate the staff to improve the <em>quality of service<\/em>. The \"imposed\" percentage supplements the fixed income, which automatically encourages the staff to pay more attention to the services provided. The Umih (Union des m\u00e9tiers et des industries de l'h\u00f4tellerie) would like to extend this bonus to more professions in the tourism industry. Receptionists would receive a tip for the quality of the welcome they offer.... Mandatory tipping can be seen as a way to let consumers know that there is a team working hard to satisfy them. In a restaurant, the kitchen staff could be thanked for the quality of the meals. They are the real workers of the quality of the meals that are served by the team in the dining room. In some establishments, tips are shared among employees, which sometimes reduces the share of those who are directly thanked by customers. If the principle becomes mandatory, each staff member would receive a tip according to the services he or she provides. There would be no need to share the <strong>extras<\/strong> because tips are distributed on the basis of the actual services rendered. The whole idea is focused on the need to recognize effort in order to encourage customers to be more generous. It is also a promise of quality: extra services mean personalized services, a warm welcome....<h2>\nThe arguments against<\/h2>\nJust the word \"mandatory\" is enough to make some professionals reluctant. Thierry Mercereau who belongs to the sector of the restoration considers that that would put off the customers. According to him, having to systematically leave a tip is comparable to the obligation to pay an additional tax. The fact of having to pay more would therefore be detrimental to the affluence because the tariffs automatically increase if one adds 10 to 15% for the service. In principle, the tip is based on the liberality, the <strong>satisfaction<\/strong> with the service. If it is compulsory, customers will still have to pay extra even if the quality of the service leaves something to be desired. <em>Maids<\/em> and wait staff would therefore have no obligation to offer a quality service since the tip would be considered an acquired right. Some arguments relate to the fact that serving customers is an integral part of the jobs of hairdressers, gas station attendants and other professionals. They are paid a fixed salary by their employers in order to provide quality services. Therefore, customers should not be obliged to show their satisfaction in cash, even if it is a symbolic dollar. This would be tantamount to forcing their hand. It would be better to keep tipping optional. It is much more motivating in the sense that it has to be earned, according to those who are against the mandatory system. At present, no profession can require tipping in France. This optional gratuity is left to the discretion of each individual. If the amounts are decreasing, so is the quality of service. Depending on how it is perceived, the compulsory tip can be a motivating factor for employees or a factor that reduces the number of people coming in. The controversy continues."},"translate-31":{"url":"women-and-the-lawyer-profession","title":"Women lawyers","h1":"Women and the legal profession","contenu":"If the world of <strong>justice<\/strong> was for a long time reserved for men, the turnaround at the bar took place around 1900. Thanks to the feminist fight for gender equality, women were allowed to practice law in that year. But even though Women's Day advocates gender equality, the lack of parity between male and <strong>female<\/strong> lawyers is still felt. From the professional life to the stars of the profession, let's take a look at the legal profession and women.<!--more--><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vecchioni-avocat-italien.com\/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-639 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/ekr39ogz.freenewstv.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/justice-femme.jpg\" alt=\"justice femme\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" \/><\/a>\n<h2>Being a woman lawyer<\/h2>\nThe <em>legal profession<\/em> requires qualities that both men and women can possess. If men have access to and practice the profession without difficulty, the same cannot be said for women. The latter are victims of persistent inequality throughout their professional life.<h3>Lawyer: a profession with an ironic female majority<\/h3>\nThe lawyer's job is to plead his clients' cases in court. Unlike the judge, the lawyer's role is biased. Of course, he defends the interests of his clients. The lawyer's role is also to assist his clients in their decision making and to negotiate with the other parties involved in the dispute. Since 2009, female lawyers have become more numerous than male lawyers. The <em>proportion of women<\/em> lawyers has even reached more than 55% in 2018. This majority does not seem to have any impact on the discrimination suffered by women lawyers. Awareness of non-discrimination also remains in vain, as one out of two female lawyers report having been discriminated against in their professional lives.<h3>Lower income and discriminatory treatment<\/h3>\nOf all the discrimination experienced by women lawyers, salary inequality is the most criticized. With the same abilities and experience, women lawyers <strong>earn<\/strong> less than their male counterparts. In addition to the income gap, women lawyers are also less likely to become partners than men.<h3>Failure to respect women's rights<\/h3>\nSome women lawyers are dismissed from their positions when they announce their pregnancy. This tramples on the rights of pregnant women if the reason for dismissal is pregnancy. Pregnant women are protected by a special status and can only be dismissed for reasons that do not depend on the fact that they are pregnant (serious misconduct or closure of the company)<h2>Famous women lawyers<\/h2>\nIn spite of all the obstacles to be faced in the exercise of the function of lawyer, some women have managed to make their name. From the first women lawyers to the great activists of rights, famous women lawyers are numerous.<h3>The pioneers of the feminization of the bar<\/h3>\nThe title of first women lawyers goes to Mrs. <em>Balachowsky-Petit<\/em> and Mrs. <strong>Jeanne Chauvin<\/strong>. Chronologically, Mrs. Balachowsky-Petit was the first to take the oath. Indeed, she acquired the first denomination of lawyer less than a week after the release of the law that authorized the access of women to the bar. However, the title of first women lawyers cannot be taken away from Mrs. Jeanne Chauvin for several reasons. First of all, she is the militant of the rights to the access of women to the bar. Through her doctorate, her law proposal aiming at accepting women to practice law and the support of other activists, the way was opened for women and the profession of lawyer. She then pleaded in court before her colleague Balachowsky-Petit, and in the corset counterfeiting case, Jeanne Chauvin was the first woman to plead in court. And finally, the oath of office was taken a few days after that of Mrs. Balachowsky-Petit.<h3>Other famous women lawyers<\/h3>\nAt the head of the famous women lawyers, we find Hillary Rodham, who became Clinton by marriage. She began her career in the defense of children's rights. She owes her reputation mainly to her entry into politics. Christine Lagarde, who started out in a law firm, is famous for being the first woman to hold the position of Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund. Gisele Halimi, known for her fight against abortion, is also on the list of famous women lawyers. Mrs. <strong>Michelle Obama<\/strong> finally has a successful front in the world of justice. The first African-American woman to become First Lady of the United States, she began her career as a lawyer with the Sidley Austin law firm. Despite the stipulation of gender equality on International Women's Day, the reality suggests that it is still a utopia. Discriminations are more felt in the field of justice, especially in the exercise of the <strong>function of lawyer<\/strong>. Is it because we still do not want to accept the fact that women can exercise a profession that, since antiquity, was dedicated exclusively to men? Whatever the reason, the facts have shown that even if these women lawyers suffer from inequalities and discrimination, this has not prevented some of them from proving their ability and shining."},"translate-32":{"url":"I'm going on vacation by who can keep my dog","title":"Dog sitting : what solutions ?","h1":"I'm going on vacation: who can take care of my dog","contenu":"When you've taken on the responsibility of a <strong>dog<\/strong>, but don't want to give up your vacation, you have two choices (and giving up is obviously not one of them).

Here are a few ideas for a serene vacation and a pet that feels good in its paws.<h2>Boarding kennels<\/h2>\nThe word \"kennel\" has a bad press but leave your prejudices aside, there are some excellent ones! You can forget about dog factories, and prefer a boarding kennel that has been recommended by a trusted person such as a friend, a veterinarian or a groomer. The dogs will evolve in society, which is very good for example in the context of training a puppy. Don't think of cages as prisons: on the one hand, your dog won't be there permanently, but will benefit from walks and moments of freedom, and on the other hand, it will be \"its own place\", because it needs a place to retreat to eat quietly and rest. Some boarding kennels even offer to take advantage of your absence to groom your dog, which is always nice when you get your <strong>pet<\/strong> back.<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-644\" src=\"http:\/\/ekr39ogz.freenewstv.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/chien-garde.jpg\" alt=\"chien garde\" width=\"632\" height=\"900\" \/>This is a regulated activity, and people who open a dog boarding kennel must have a professional certificate, a certificate of competence or a knowledge certificate. They must also comply with hygiene rules such as cleaning the cages once a day and disinfecting them once a month. Unless your dog has a special diet, its meals are often included in the price of the boarding. Do not hesitate, during your research, to visit the place. You will see how you feel, the cleanliness, the cages of the dogs, the light, the ventilation, the temperature... It's the best way to leave with peace of mind. If you live in the 06, I recommend <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dogattitude06.fr\/pension-garde-chien\/\">Dog Attitude<\/a>.<h2>With a relative<\/h2>\nIf you don't want to entrust your pet to a stranger, even if he is a professional, you can look for a host family among your relatives to <strong>keep your dog<\/strong>. This can be a person who does not have the leisure of owning a dog but who will be happy to host one from time to time, people with a large yard who have some free time to take care of your animal, or relatives who know your dog well and to whom your dog is used to. They will undoubtedly behave as if the dog was theirs, giving it affection and care accordingly. They also have the emotional part concerning you: they will take care of the animal by respect for you. And for you, we note on the one hand the not negligible financial aspect (you will probably have to provide only the kibbles) and on the other hand, on the side of serenity, as you know the people, you will be in confidence. On the other hand, be careful not to get angry with your dog's guardian for a trifle or a more important event. Let's go back to insurance: you can also check with your own home insurance to make sure that your civil liability covers any damage your dog might do to someone else's home (door chewing, breakage...). Good accounts make good friends, and insurance coverage avoids any chill in the relationship! Keeping your pet is not a trivial act. You love your animal and you want it to be as comfortable as possible in a boarding facility so that it does not suffer from your absence. These different options have advantages and disadvantages: it's up to you to see which one suits you best."},"translate-33":{"url":"decoration-object-vintage-writing-machine","title":"Vintage objects are now part of your decor","h1":"Vintage objects: the new trend","contenu":"Vintage is more than ever in the spotlight and is a great success in interior design.

Thanks to this remote practice of clairvoyance, it is no longer necessary to physically move to the office of a practitioner: you stay at home, in a secure environment. This can only simplify the interaction and allow a better diffusion of energies.<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-672\" src=\"http:\/\/ekr39ogz.freenewstv.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/tarot.jpg\" alt=\"tarot\" width=\"640\" height=\"960\" \/>If you doubt that a consultation of clairvoyance <strong>by telephone<\/strong> can be useful to you, tell yourself that your interlocutor does not need your physical presence at his side to elaborate reliable predictions. Generally, he will need some essential information that you can provide him with over the phone. This information is usually your date and place of birth, which is used to determine your natal chart. For the rest, your <em>professional psychic<\/em> is able to feel even from a distance certain characteristic energies that you transmit to him - notably by the intonation of your voice. Are you intrigued by this first approach? You should know that <strong>remote predictions<\/strong> are just as effective as more \"traditional\" methods. Better yet, they are becoming increasingly popular with a wide range of people who do not necessarily have the time to travel, or who are unable to do so. By making the choice of an immediate clairvoyance of audiotel type, you enter in contact with a serious person, practising regularly the<em>art of the divination<\/em> under various forms. You will then have the possibility of asking him all your questions in connection with your sentimental daily life, as you would do it in a traditional situation. Note to finish that the clairvoyance by audiotel does not imply on your part a payment by bank card: only the duration of the call is charged to you.<h2>What are the divinatory arts that can be practiced by phone?<\/h2>\nAs we have implied above, the art of divination is a complex discipline that encompasses many different practices: some professionals prefer to use \"intuitive\" practices to deliver their predictions, others prefer to rely on \"rational\" methods - this is a major distinction in the art of divination, between clairvoyance and <strong>mantics<\/strong>. In the end, the objective is to bring you the most precise answer to your questioning, by using for it tools adapted to the nature of your concerns. For example, the <strong>tarot reading<\/strong> by audiotel is a reality. The consultation takes place almost in the same way as a classic consultation, except that you are at home and that you enter in relation with specialists of tarology. It is then up to these clairvoyance professionals to draw the cards for you, after a question and answer session that will allow your interlocutor to connect to your inner self. Some clairvoyance professionals still use traditional processes to reveal possible futures, such as the <strong>crystal ball<\/strong>. Therefore, you might be entitled to ask yourself the question: is a remote clairvoyance by this means effective? In this case, the crystal ball can be considered as a simple \"receptacle\" of all your emotions and all the energies that you produce. These elements which then allow your <em>clairvoyant<\/em> to make his predictions. The exercise is completely conceivable within the framework of a clairvoyance by audiotel, even if the degree of concentration will probably be more demanding than for a traditional consultation. For you as for your extra-lucid interlocutor, it is advisable to be the most opened and relaxed possible!<h2>How does a telephone clairvoyance consultation work?<\/h2>\nAs we have seen above, the consultation by phone is done in reassuring and secure conditions: on your side, this method allows you to be free of your movements and to call from any place where you feel good - it can be your home at first, but also your office or a familiar place. On the other hand, audiotel psychics are for the most part grouped within a single <strong>practice<\/strong> or platform. Before starting, make sure that you are accessing professionals declared in France, so as not to come across a call center abroad. Most of the time, you will have at your disposal several profiles with a short presentation, and a rating system that will allow you to see the appreciations left by previous clients. It is then up to you to choose one of the professionals presented, depending on what you are looking for. From this point on, please note that you are subject to a per-minute rate, which will be deducted from your telephone bill. But don't worry: the waiting time is extremely limited in most cases. Likewise, each consultation is optimized to the maximum, so as to provide you with a <strong>quality<\/strong> service and <strong>clairvoyance<\/strong>.<h2>What are the advantages of a clairvoyance by audiotel?<\/h2>\nYou are certainly wondering what the advantages of a telephone consultation for a professional clairvoyance can be? In reality, if this practice is developing more and more on the French territory, it is first and foremost for its practical side: indeed, the cabinets of consultation of clairvoyance do not exist everywhere, and it can be very difficult for certain people to move physically to a point of appointment - that it is for personal or professional reasons. Secondly, it is important to remember that a telephone psychic consultation can reduce the waiting time considerably. Not only do you not need to make an appointment in advance, but audiotel psychics work 24\/7. Moreover, it can be intimidating to reveal parts of your private life to a professional psychic, and the framework of a physical consultation does not always help to deliver. When you contact an extra-lucid clairvoyant by audiotel, you will not encounter this kind of difficulty. It will be easier for you to communicate your fears and to listen to the prediction corresponding to the situation that you meet. The economy constituted by a telephone clairvoyance is not negligible: not only do you save a physical displacement, but you profit from an advantageous tariffing per minute, without having necessarily to resort to your bank card for the payment. In other words, on the practical and economic plan, the advantages of a remote clairvoyance are numerous. The clairvoyance by audiotel does not really differ from a traditional consultation in cabinet. The extra-lucid clairvoyant, who has a powerful natural gift, is able to enter in relation with you by multiple means. Some disciplines of divinatory arts rely heavily on sensations, energies and \"flashes\" that give the clairvoyant the ability to detect probable futures. These different elements are also communicated from a distance, thanks to the way you use your voice and the general sensitivity that emerges when you talk about your situation. Of course, to ensure the most accurate prediction possible, you must provide your interlocutor with as much essential information as possible: this information can be, for example, your place of birth and your date of birth, as well as any information likely to help solve your questioning. In the end, the prediction will turn out to be as accurate as if you had been there! Another advantage of an online consultation, and not the least, is the consequent choice that is offered to you in terms of practitioners! Most of the time, when you contact a clairvoyant by audiotel, you have at your disposal several profiles noted and classified according to their field of predilection. Some of these clairvoyants will specialize in tarot and cards, others will be able to provide you with a rare energetic gift that will produce excellent results, even at a distance. It is up to you to make a choice from there. You should also know that if a particular profile catches your attention, you have the possibility to book your interview with him\/her via a schedule. In other words, an audiotel clairvoyance can greatly help you in every way, and greatly alleviate your concerns: you receive an effective prediction in a short time, at any time of the day and thanks to a team of hand-picked clairvoyance professionals.<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-671\" src=\"http:\/\/ekr39ogz.freenewstv.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/consultation-voyance-par-telephone.jpg\" alt=\"consultation voyance par telephone\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" \/><h2>How to prepare for this consultation?<\/h2>\nWhen you enter into a <strong>telephone relationship<\/strong> with a clairvoyant, you must prepare yourself as much as possible in order to obtain the most effective prediction possible. To begin with, put yourself at ease and relax your mind, so as to allow your interlocutor to connect with your inner energies. Then, as we have seen earlier in this publication, it may be important to think of some information that is essential to the analysis of your situation: you do not need to transmit a picture of yourself or to go too far in describing your situation. Sometimes, simple emanations of energies may arise when you talk about a situation that is close to your heart - it may be sentimental, or concerns related to your professional future. Nevertheless, it can be useful to give some practical information, in order to reveal your astral chart and to reveal the possibilities which are offered to you.

Nevertheless, you need a substantial budget to embark on a purchase project and the amount required can largely exceed the savings you have built up. This is where a mortgage comes in, as it allows you to finance this project that is so important to you.<!--more--><h2>What is a real estate loan?<\/h2>\nBy definition, a loan is a device that allows you to obtain a sum of money from a financing organization. We speak of a <strong>real estate loan<\/strong> when the loan is specifically intended to finance a real estate project. If your project consists of maintaining a property through improvements and\/or repairs, you will need to apply for a loan for work on the property from your bank.<h2>What are the different interest rates of a real estate loan ?<\/h2>\nThe <strong>interest rate<\/strong> corresponds to the percentage taken by the bank as remuneration. This remuneration is included in the monthly loan payment.<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-675\" src=\"http:\/\/ekr39ogz.freenewstv.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/assurance-pret-immobilier.jpg\" alt=\"assurance pret immobilier\" width=\"1279\" height=\"960\" \/>The interest rate can be fixed. In this case, it is defined in advance and fixed in time. A simple calculation allows you to know the amount it represents and your monthly payments. You can also opt for a revisable or variable interest rate. In this case, it can go up as well as down. This means that the monthly payments you will owe are subject to variations over the duration of your mortgage. Some adjustable rates are capped, so variations are limited. The annual percentage rate of charge, more commonly known as the APR, corresponds to the total cost of the loan. Expressed as a percentage, it includes the sum of the interests and various expenses (insurance, file fees...) related to the requested credit. The APR must be mentioned in the loan offer submitted by the credit institution.<h2>What type of insurance should I take out for this type of loan ?<\/h2>\nAny real estate loan is systematically accompanied by a <strong>borrower's insurance<\/strong>. The subscription is not compulsory in the legal sense but constitutes a condition of granting at the level of the majority of the financial establishments. Thus, the credit institutions propose a basic <em>real estate loan insurance<\/em>. The contracts are elaborated to suit the greatest number of people, it is a question of mutualizing the risk between all the insured. It is thus more advantageous to play the competition by knowing that the guarantees to be respected are defined by the law. As they vary from one group contract to another, it is important to compare the guarantees and options offered to you. Your contract commits the insurer to reimburse you in the event of an emergency. The guarantees subscribed to will obviously determine the situations in which your insurer can intervene. A monthly reimbursement is possible if your difficulties in repaying the monthly payments are of a temporary or permanent nature. The temporary total incapacity to work (ITT) guarantee covers the period during which your state of health or your physical condition prevents you from engaging in activities that generate income. The loss of employment guarantee will be useful if you are dismissed by your employer before the expiry of your mortgage. The insurer can proceed to the reimbursement of the remaining capital due in case of death, sometimes in case of total permanent disability (IPT) or total and irreversible loss of autonomy (PTIA). The insurer will need to see proof that you have lost all possibility of working and therefore of generating income to pay your monthly instalments. Some mortgage insurance contracts widen the scope of possibilities by including more specific <strong>cover<\/strong>. There are offers dedicated to people practicing risky sports such as acrobatics, motor racing, off-track skiing, marathon riding, etc. Depending on the<strong>insurer<\/strong> selected, you have the possibility of including coverage for high-risk occupations. These are occupations that are subject to higher than normal risks, both in terms of death and possible disability. This includes, for example, construction workers, firemen, law enforcement officers and security guards.... Delegation of insurance -subscribing a contract with a third party insurance company- is provided for by the <em>Lagarde law <\/em>in force since 2010. Not only are you free to choose your insurer, but you also have the possibility to <strong>change your insurance company<\/strong> during the course of your loan by exercising the Hamon Law or the Sapin 2 Law (Bourquin amendment). The <strong>Hamon Law<\/strong> gives you the opportunity to change insurer within 11 months and 15 days of signing the contract. The Sapin 2 Law allows you to sign another contract at each anniversary of your current contract. In concrete terms, you have the possibility to change insurer once a year by making sure to respect a notice period of 2 months in relation to the anniversary date. Each change is subject to conditions. You must therefore make sure that the guarantees offered by the <strong>new contract<\/strong> are at least equivalent to those of your current insurance. If necessary, you can include new optional guarantees to better adapt the coverage to your needs. In some cases, it is possible to <strong>renegotiate the loan insurance<\/strong>. Choose your arguments carefully by mentioning, for example, more advantageous rates from competing insurers. If the negotiation is not successful, you can cancel your contract in favor of a more attractive offer. Not only do you have the prospect of saving money on your insurance, but you also gain peace of mind thanks to the adequacy of the guarantees offered to you. Waiting periods, exclusions, reimbursement methods, every detail counts when it comes to loan insurance. So be careful.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.changersonassurancedepret.com\/\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-676\" src=\"http:\/\/ekr39ogz.freenewstv.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/pret-immobilier.jpg\" alt=\"assurance pret immobilier\" width=\"1280\" height=\"959\" \/><\/a>\n<h2>What guarantees are required by the bank?<\/h2>\nA real estate loan application requires a solid file, with supporting documents. In addition to an appropriate insurance contract, the establishments ask for documents attesting to your capacity to repay your loan. Proof of income is therefore required. The debt ratio being limited to 33% of your income, the amount of the loan and\/or the repayment period will depend on it. The personal contribution is also a common selection criterion for banks. Borrowers who can finance an average of 20% of the <strong>real estate project <\/strong>are thus privileged. If it is about the purchase of your first main residence, a personal contribution of 10% is generally enough to convince the banks. To launch out in a real estate project is a beautiful adventure, more especially as the credits simplify the <em>financing<\/em>. However, make sure you are well informed about the different fees, in particular about the insurance linked to your loan."},"translate-36":{"url":"ou-acheter-un-vaporisateur","title":"The purchase of a vaporizer","h1":"Where to buy a vaporizer?","contenu":"Many plants have unsuspected medicinal virtues and vaporization is one of the best ways to extract their active ingredients.

The choice concerns first of all the brand, knowing that several quality manufacturers share this market. One of these is St\u00f6rz &amp; Bickel which is one of the best brands in this field with several historical vaporizers. Arizer Tech is also among the most recommended manufacturers by vaping enthusiasts. Among the best references of Arizer Tech, we can mention Arizer Air or Arizer Argo.

However, they are getting a facelift to better highlight the value of the malls while providing more original experiences. Let's take a closer look at this revolution, which has been skilfully shaped by event professionals.<h2><!--more-->The new generation of shopping centers<\/h2>\nMalls are evolving in the sense that they are no longer just places dedicated to shopping. They are spaces that promote exchanges. They arouse emotions and offer access to relaxation areas. In other words, shopping malls are becoming places for living. The<strong> retailtainment<\/strong> trend (a contraction of retail and <em>entertainment<\/em>) has thus been born. The concept is based on the use of entertaining solutions to attract and hold the attention of visitors. The objective of real estate companies may seem ambitious, but the new generation of shopping centers is actually succeeding in standing out. The transformation obviously requires a more advanced marketing strategy. And it also requires a more varied and broader approach.<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-693\" src=\"http:\/\/ekr39ogz.freenewstv.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/centre-commercial.jpg\" alt=\"centre commercial\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" \/>The<strong> shopping <\/strong>experience remains a key objective, as it is a fundamental reason for the existence of shopping centers. However, the pleasure of wandering the galleries and the playfulness are now inseparable from spaces that are in tune with the times.<h2>Activities and events closer to the customer<\/h2>\nWe won't go so far as to say that the classic<em>shopping<\/em> path is of no interest to <em>consumers<\/em>. On the other hand, we can say that they are more demanding. They want a more original shopping experience and they do not fail to express their expectations. The organizers and creators of events are therefore competing in ingenuity to satisfy consumers. The competition remains a highly popular concept. However, prizes are becoming more attractive thanks to their higher value. All-inclusive trips, new vehicles and other trendy prizes such as gift certificates are gaining ground. By attracting attention in this way, shopping centers see the number of customers increase and are able to retain them with greater ease. The quality of the prizes is also a reflection of the services and products. By focusing on this, shopping centers can send a powerful message. Consumers make their decisions based on many factors. First and foremost, they need to be seduced by what is being offered. They also need to feel confident before making the move. The possibility to take advantage of personalized offers is obviously an important loyalty vector. These are all criteria that serve as a basis for the animations and events of the new generation. Let's not forget the importance of product testing, which is now a highly decisive factor. The stands are therefore multiplying to allow consumers to try the experiences they need before making a purchase. This ranges from make-up sessions to food tastings, as well as drone and other electronic product trials. The fun of testing increases the sales potential of a given product\/service and makes the shopping experience radically different from the ordinary, so <strong>malls<\/strong> that have decided to embrace new entertainment practices naturally attract more people than those that stick with old practices. The increase in traffic is beneficial for the brands, which gain in visibility. They have more opportunities to promote and defend their values, which is part of an effective marketing strategy. The events that are being developed in shopping centers are often inspired by television shows. The themes addressed are constantly multiplying, certainly increasing the attractiveness of the sales areas.<h2>Marketing that appeals to the emotions<\/h2>\nShopping centers collaborate with agencies specialized in <strong>event<\/strong> creation such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.doubleje.fr\/\">Double Je<\/a>. These agencies focus on audacity so that the shopping experience becomes more atypical. Every detail, such as the staging, the theme, the choice of the animations themselves... allows the shopping centers and the participating brands to create a buzz. Consumers no longer come just to see. <strong>Emotional marketing<\/strong> is developed in response to consumer expectations. The latter are willing to let themselves be guided by their emotions, a criterion that retailers and brands wishing to gain visibility do not hesitate to develop. It is not only a question of proposing products and\/or services that stand out, but of seducing consumers, of playing on their emotions to make them vibrate. Thus, the centers do not hesitate to offer wellness coaching, to organize culinary workshops or to bet on sports activities to establish a relationship of trust punctuated by a pleasant experience. In a world where digitalization is an integral part of everyday life, the shopping experience is simplified by digital services that accompany consumers. New <em>experiences<\/em> are generally organized during high-traffic periods such as Easter, Christmas and the summer vacations. Shopping centers can also take advantage of special occasions (birthdays, for example) to engage their visitors in a more dynamic and sensory environment."},"translate-38":{"url":"lorganization-of-festival-and-use-of-smoking-machines","title":"Fog machines: what use are they in the organization of a festive event","h1":"The organization of a festive event and the use of smoke machines","contenu":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If during the organization of a party, the invitations, the music and the decoration are often not a problem, the major concern remains the success of the animation.

You should know that in many parts of the world there is a real alternative culture in the field of the study of signs.<!--more-->Chinese astrology, for example, is undoubtedly one of the most popular in the world and allows you to understand your destiny in a way that is quite different from Western astrology. Indeed, who has never wanted to know his Chinese astrological sign, if only out of curiosity? Through this publication, we will see what the roots of Chinese astrology are, and how this discipline can work for you on a daily basis.<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-705\" src=\"http:\/\/ekr39ogz.freenewstv.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/astrologie-chinoise.jpg\" alt=\"astrologie chinoise\" width=\"1200\" height=\"795\" \/><h2>The history of Chinese astrology<\/h2>\nChinese astrology is much older than our Western astrological model - it dates back to 3 millennia BC. The only thing that seems to change is that the Chinese zodiac has symbols, legends and character traits. At the origin of its history, Chinese astrology is strongly influenced by traditional astronomical and religious notions. At the beginning, however, only the great ones of this world had the right to practice astrology or to receive its teachings: it was the Emperor Huang Di who forbade scientists who were not part of his court to practice astrology. The reason was more political than <em>superstitious <\/em>: it was necessary at all costs to avoid that his enemies use this science to try to detect the weakness of their enemies! Thus, it seems that it is during the reign of Emperor Huang Di in the 3rd millennium BC that the first Chinese astrological calendar appeared. The legend is complex to decipher but most of them tell how the animals of the zodiac were chosen by Buddha to participate in a race to decide between them. The rat, faster and smarter than the other animals, was the first to reach the finish line, beating the ox to become the first sign of the horoscope. The other animals arrived in this very precise order: the ox (on which the rat had traveled), the tiger, the rabbit, the dragon, the snake, the horse, the goat, the monkey, the rooster, the dog and finally the pig. These different sacred creatures in China would have been in fact imported from India or Tibet. Thus, unlike Western astrology (which is essentially based on the Sun), Chinese astrology likes to observe the movements of the <strong>Moon <\/strong>or \"lunar years\". A lunar year is therefore logically composed of 12 moons, or even 13 moons every 12 years. The cycle of the Chinese horoscope is therefore viewed over a period of 12 years instead of 12 months. In fact, each year is symbolized by a creature of the zodiac, this one exerting a determining influence on the destinies and the character traits of the people born that year.<h2>How does Chinese astrology work?<\/h2>\nAs we have seen above, the Chinese zodiac is made up of 12 signs classified in a very precise order. Each of these signs refers to an animal and therefore has particular characteristics. Thus, in order to better understand human characteristics, it is necessary to look at the specificities of the 12 animals of the zodiac. Chinese culture attaches a lot of importance to the spiritual relationships that exist between man and these 12 creatures: it must be said that certain combinations can greatly increase your chances of making a fortune! Let's look together at what your Chinese horoscope says about you according to the sign that is associated with you. Of course, when you inherit your sign's strengths, you also inherit its weaknesses! In fact, always keep in mind that certain characteristics of your animal can facilitate or hinder a relationship depending on the case: - For all the people born under the sign of the rat: you are systematically associated with someone who is quick-witted, capable of mobilizing many resources; - For all the people born under the sign of the ox: you are considered as a studious, reliable, strong and determined person; - For all the people born under the sign of the tiger: you are a person who particularly likes competition, and who shows a certain bravery.\n\n- For all the people born under the sign of the rabbit: just like your pet, you are capable of showing a lot of kindness and responsibility, in addition to being quite discreet. For all the people born under the sign of the dragon: the dragon is considered to be confident, intelligent and enthusiastic.\n\n- For all people born under the sign of the snake: you are considered enigmatic, intelligent with a great capacity to show clairvoyance. For all people born under the sign of the horse: they are considered energetic, and even develop a certain sense of repartee. For all people born under the sign of the sheep: the sheep is an animal considered calm, soft and sympathetic in China. Its main element is Fire, and it manifests a feminine sensitivity - indeed, the animal belongs to the signs of the Yin polarity. - For all the people born under the sign of the Monkey: you are lively, intelligent and you show a curiosity without any common measure. - For all the people born under the sign of the Rooster: the Rooster is reputed to be very observant. For all the people born under the sign of the dog: the dog is a cute, honest, careful and loyal animal. So, if you are lucky enough to be attached to this particular sign, know that you will tend to develop a certain form of empathy towards your loved ones. You will do everything to help them as best you can. For all those born under the sign of the pig: the pig is considered a sensitive, generous and studious animal. In doing so, please note that the Chinese New Year takes place every year on a date that changes regularly, between the months of January and February. Thus, all people born between January 1st and Chinese New Year should refer to the animal that actually corresponds to the previous year.<h2>How to know your Chinese zodiac sign?<\/h2>\nYou want to know your Chinese zodiac sign, but you do not know how to proceed? As we mentioned earlier, each year has a specific sign. So you'll need to wait 12 years for your sign to appear and be able to celebrate your year as it should be. For example, the year 2020 is the year of the rat, while the following year will be the year of the ox, and so on according to the order of the animals. This is probably one of the main distinctions with the western astrological system, which assigns a month to each sign. Here, with the Chinese \"lunisolar\" horoscope, each sign evolves over a period of one year. Would you like to learn more about the main characteristics of your favorite sign? For that, you have several options at your disposal, although the best of them remains the audiotel: you are in relation to distance with a professional of the divination, which knows well the Chinese divinatory arts and can thus accompany you on the way of the revelation.<h2>What can Chinese astrology reveal about you?<\/h2>\nAs you might expect, astrology (whether Chinese or Western) can tell you a lot about yourself and your main character traits. For example, your Chinese sign can help you better understand the particularities of your inner nature, but it can also give you more information about your love compatibility. As you know, there are 12 signs in Chinese astrology, which you can easily obtain by telling your astrologer your date of birth. Now, each of these \"signs\" has a real influence on the behavior, the personality and the character traits of an individual. So, when you take all of these distinctive signs that make up your personality, you can compare them with another sign in order to detect a possible harmony. You think you are a rat <strong>sign<\/strong>? If the person you're trying to find love for is also of the same sign, the chances of success are slim. On the other hand, it seems that the compatibility between the rat and the dragon is ideal! The buffalo is also a great friend of the rat: the love compatibility here will be based on trust! The rat and the buffalo complement each other wonderfully and have a real mutual trust. You think you are a rabbit? Know for example that the love <em>compatibility<\/em> between the rat and the rabbit is doomed to failure. Indeed and according to the Chinese horoscope, there will be not only physical incompatibility but also incompatibility of character. The union between a rabbit and a dragon will not work in the long term either, the dragon always seeking to have the ascendancy, and only seeking to shine within the couple. You are the sign of the monkey? Even if the sign of the rat is not the ideal one to start a love relationship, it will be able on the other hand to be born a beautiful friendship. Why not give it a try? If you are confronted with a person endowed with the sign of the rabbit, the happiness is not far and a beautiful relation could be born in the long run. On the other hand, with a person born under the sign of the dragon, the compatibility is only 50%. So you'd better take a look at how your relationship is going in the long run, to see what the outcome will be.<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-706\" src=\"http:\/\/ekr39ogz.freenewstv.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/astrologies-chinoise.jpg\" alt=\"astrologies chinoise\" width=\"1200\" height=\"732\" \/>In conclusion, Chinese astrology is an excellent alternative to Western divination methods. Although both disciplines share similar elements (such as the 12 signs of the <strong>zodiac<\/strong>), Chinese astrology bases its expertise on a 12-year lunar cycle. So, if you want to celebrate the Chinese New Year, you should know that an astrological year begins at the time of the New Moon, which takes place between January and February.

It is therefore necessary that the lawyer be perfectly organized so that no element, no information escapes him. He must be able to prioritize his cases in relation to time, knowing that he may be called upon to advise\/defend several clients in the same period. Organizational skills are also reflected in the ability to delegate certain tasks. Good lawyers do not hesitate to surround themselves with a team to assist them.<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-712\" src=\"http:\/\/ekr39ogz.freenewstv.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/avocats.jpg\" alt=\"avocats\" width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" \/>His <em>collaborators<\/em> can thus take charge of looking for the necessary information for the various cases, of noting his appointments, of taking messages if he is temporarily unavailable ....

A good lawyer will listen to you carefully. He will not judge you. The lawyer asks about your motives and goals. He or she will then help you understand the specifics of your case so that you can assess the potential risks and understand the benefits of complying with the various proposals made by your advisor\/representative.<h2>Tenacious<\/h2>\nThere are <strong>cases<\/strong> that are both complex and delicate. They can feel like there is no end in sight because of the many unforeseen events and obstacles. When taking on such cases, the lawyer must be very persistent in order to stay focused on his or her primary objective: defending your interests. Progress may be slow, but instead of being discouraged and throwing in the towel, a good lawyer is persistent. They will take the time to find new evidence and will follow up on the progress of your case on a regular basis.<h2>Patient<\/h2>\nPatience goes hand in hand with tenacity because results are not necessarily immediate. In particular, research may take several weeks before it yields concrete and relevant information. In some cases, it can take several months for the lawyer to build a solid case that will allow him to develop the best strategy to protect you from legal problems or to defend you in a legal action.

Your lawyer must also be able to defend your case and it is imperative that he or she be able to bounce back from the imponderables that may arise.<h2>Be logical<\/h2>\nAll of the lawyer's interventions are based on information gathered, whether it comes from his own research or from a third party (possibly an opponent). <em>Logic <\/em>is therefore essential, as the information in his hands must be studied objectively. A good lawyer is thus able to make a reasonable judgment.<h2>Mastering the French language<\/h2>\nThe French language is known for its complexity. An excellent command of the language is therefore essential, not only orally but also in writing. The lawyer must be able to write different types of documents by emphasizing both his writing skills and his mastery of the law. Arguments, contract clauses... everything that will be mentioned will obviously be based on the logic previously mentioned.<h2>Have an analytical mind<\/h2>\nAlthough it is not necessary to make personal judgments, a good lawyer must be able to effectively analyze all the information at his disposal. These analytical skills will enable him to gauge the relevance of a detail, the need to investigate further or, conversely, to focus on something else.<h2>Be a good speaker<\/h2>\nNot every case ends up in<strong> court<\/strong>. Nevertheless, it is an eventuality for which a good lawyer must be properly prepared. Therefore, speaking should not make him\/her feel uncomfortable as he\/she may be required to speak in public.<h2>Be captivating<\/h2>\nIt is not enough to be at ease or to know how to juggle words to be a good lawyer. You must also know how to capture attention. The manner of speaking, the intonation, the ability to adapt the speech to the people listening are all indispensable qualities.<h2>Being social<\/h2>\nRelational skills are essential because the lawyer will meet people with different profiles during his or her career, or even during the same case. These encounters can open doors to new leads, provided that the people they meet feel confident enough to confide in them. Moreover, it is rare that a lawyer works alone. He generally has a professional network that he activates to support him in his missions. But he must be social!<a href=\"https:\/\/www.vecchioni-avocat-italien.com\/\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-711\" src=\"http:\/\/ekr39ogz.freenewstv.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/avocat.jpg\" alt=\"avocat\" width=\"1201\" height=\"801\" \/><\/a>\n<h2>Have good judgment<\/h2>\nA good <strong>lawyer<\/strong> does not wait for the verdict to be delivered before predicting what will happen next. His analytical sense favors the development of his capacity of judgment. He can examine the case from all angles to identify the advantages and shortcomings. Depending on the case, new hypotheses may have to be developed before the verdict is reached in order to ensure that your case is as strong as possible. All of the above qualities define a good lawyer. Add to this the fact that money should not be the only motivation. A good lawyer thinks first of his client. Therefore, the quality of the services provided should be the same regardless of your financial means."},"translate-41":{"url":"focus-tarology","title":"Do you know tarology?","h1":"Focus on tarology","contenu":"To make an important choice, or to get out of a delicate situation, the right advice is not necessarily given by a relative or a friend. This is why many of us turn to a professional psychic. Psychic techniques can be diverse, but there is one that has long been proven to be effective: it uses the power of cards.<!--more-->[caption id=\"attachment_725\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"650\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-725\" src=\"http:\/\/ekr39ogz.freenewstv.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/tarologie.jpg\" alt=\"tarologie\" width=\"650\" height=\"433\" \/> The benefits of tarology.[\/caption]<h2>What is tarology?<\/h2>\nTarology is a <strong>divinatory method<\/strong> that uses cards. The best known deck of cards used in divination is the Tarot de Marseille, but it is far from being the only deck used. In tarology, the clairvoyant, according to the symbolism of the cards, can decipher the present and thus help us to know ourselves better. He can also read the future and make predictions, valuable to help us find a better path in life. The tarot divinatory is therefore a powerful support to see the hidden meaning of the present, as well as an esoteric technique to decipher the future. Its strength is to be immediately operational for the consultant, who can quickly use the predictions delivered to improve his life. It is undoubtedly the reason for the constant success of tarology, for centuries and on all continents. It should be noted that tarot and astrology are very close, each card corresponding with signs of earth, fire, water or air. There are several forms of tarot, but it is generally a deck of 78 cards, rich in complex and colorful iconography.<h2>The Angel Tarot<\/h2>\nThe <strong>Angel Tarot<\/strong> is traditionally a 78-card deck, with a guardian angel represented on each card. The first known Angel Tarot decks were found in the 14th century. Currently, some Angel Tarot decks have as few as 22 or 32 cards, while others have as many as 81 cards. The Angel Tarot is a powerful deck that reflects the mission of the guardian angels to watch over and guide us. The most iconic cards in the Angel Tarot evoke giving, healing, tenderness, knowledge or abundance. In any case, whatever the number of cards, the Angel Tarot is a benevolent deck dedicated to the light. It wants to dispel doubts and reassure. It is precious to know what your assets are, in any situation. Very precise in its revelations, this type of tarot is particularly effective in helping to make a decision. The cards should be drawn in a quiet place, conducive to serenity. Each angel represented has its own story, and can bring specific benefits. Sometimes, the drawing starts simply by drawing a single card, to know which is the guardian angel of the consultant. Then the reading becomes plural, and more complex, to know how to decipher the present and to know, of course, the range of possible futures. The images of the Angel Tarot are very beautiful and inspire serenity and peace. The Angel Tarot is finally a subtle tool and very pleasant to use, because it gives off strong positive vibes, just like the angels, who are only goodness and love. The angels are very easy to use this deck of cards, because it helps them to fulfill their mission as <em>celestial messengers<\/em> and guardians of our happiness. The Angel Tarot is mainly used to help make the right decisions in the near future. It is possible to draw the cards yourself, but the results are much better if you call upon a professional clairvoyant, used to dialogue with the beyond, able to capture the positive energies and messages of the angels.<h2>The Tarot of Marseille<\/h2>\nThe Tarot de <strong>Marseille<\/strong> is the king of all divinatory card games. For the record, it was not born in Marseille, but in Lyon, and it comes from an Italian deck of cards. The Tarot de Marseille, as it is commonly known, is a very intuitive deck, rich in symbolism, used in fortune-telling at least since the 16th century. The cards represent characters, for example the Pope, the hanged man, the bateleur, a devil and his two imps, or objects and celestial bodies from medieval iconography, for example the wheel of fortune, the chariot, the star, the sun or the moon. The deck consists of 78 cards, also known as blades. Of these, 22 cards are major<strong> arcana<\/strong>, or triumphs. Each arcana has both a negative and a positive meaning: it is the fortune teller who will be able to read the card in the right way and retain the relevant meaning(s). For example, the bateleur, which is the first blade of the Tarot de Marseille and one of the major arcana, represents a man standing behind a furnished table, holding a stick. He represents youth and active energy, life force and health. But it can also represent indecision and impulsiveness, lack of wisdom or self-confidence. Another illustration, the Goddess, the second major card of this tarot, represents a seated woman holding an open book. She symbolizes knowledge and holds the book of wisdom. This card can signify the power of achievement, support and comfort, benevolence and fruitfulness. It is a sign of success in projects. But this card can also express withdrawal, inertia, lack of action, closed situations. Another example, the Nameless Arcanum is probably one of the strangest cards in the Tarot de Marseille. It is the thirteenth card. It represents a skeleton holding a scythe and symbolizes what is essential in us. The figure is reaping the past and bringing new projects out of our unconscious. It can suggest the project of turning the page, of getting rid of what is useless, of making a clean sweep of the past. It can therefore have the positive meaning of wanting to move forward and imply renewal, changes of habit. [caption id=\"attachment_726\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"650\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-726\" src=\"http:\/\/ekr39ogz.freenewstv.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/oracle.jpg\" alt=\"oracle\" width=\"650\" height=\"395\" \/> The features of the oracle in tarology.[\/caption] But in its dark side, the character of this card cuts off abruptly and too quickly, it can express a tendency to destroy what one has built, or an inability to detach oneself from the past or to mourn someone or something. The remaining 56 cards are minor arcana, which help refine the predictions of the cards. From there, the techniques of drawing are diverse, depending on the question asked, and the experience of the <strong>fortune teller<\/strong>. The most commonly used is the 3 card draw, which allows to quickly answer a precise question. The first cards can then be covered by others, drawn by the consultant, to reach more subtle conclusions. The cards are drawn by the left hand, the hand of the heart. The cross drawing is another method: by drawing 4 or even 5 cards and arranging them in a cross, the consultant will call up the reading of his present and future. He will know his fears and desires, his assets and his obstacles. The <em>astrological wheel<\/em> method, often used at the beginning of the year, or on the occasion of a birthday, allows the consultant to draw 12 cards, like the 12 astrological houses of the birth chart. The methods of drawing are thus diverse. It all depends on the questions asked, the fortune teller's habits, his sensitivity and his knowledge of the cards. What is certain is that the Tarot de Marseille gives precise and clear answers about the past, the present and the future. It can allow you to positively influence the course of your life.<h2>The tarot of love<\/h2>\nTo see more clearly in your heart, there is nothing like the love tarot. The problems of love are very particular, and as such require a tarot and card drawing techniques dedicated to them. The sentimental <strong>destinies<\/strong> include extremely varied questions, such as the meeting of a soul mate, the possibility of a commitment, the decision or the possibility of having children, and the importance of fidelity. All of these form a specific set of questions and require specific answers, but most of the time it is not a particular tarot that is used to obtain information about the consultant's love destiny. It is simply the traditional Tarot de Marseille, but the drawing of the cards is particularly dedicated to love fortune telling. The best thing for the consultant is to list his or her precise questions in advance. He can also, during the consultation, take notes on the information that is delivered to him, to be sure to receive everything. Some answers are not easy to hear, and a good clairvoyant has the duty to answer without complacency. So it is necessary to take the time to listen well to all the course of the consultation, to prepare a better future.<h2>The Oracle of Belline<\/h2>\nThis game, and the tarology technique associated with it, comes from the 19th century. The cards were drawn by the magician Edmond between 1845 and 1865. Marcel Belline, a famous clairvoyant of the 1950's, had great success using these cards. The Oracle of Belline consists of 53 cards and is based on the seven fundamental planets: the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn and Mars. On this basis, there are 7 groups of 7 cards, each associated with one of the planets, plus an additional 4 cards. These are the woman's star, the man's star, the key to destiny, and there is also a blue card, symbol of protection. There are several drawing techniques that can be used, such as the cross or 6-card draw, or the evolution draw [caption id=\"attachment_727\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"650\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-727\" src=\"http:\/\/ekr39ogz.freenewstv.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/tarot.jpg\" alt=\"tarot\" width=\"650\" height=\"433\" \/> Different types of tarot to learn[\/caption] It all depends on the questions asked, and the habits of the psychic. You can ask very precise questions. From the draw obtained, and thanks to the explanations of the clairvoyance professional, you will quickly see much more clearly on your life path. The<strong>Oracle of Belline <\/strong>is known to be a particularly effective divinatory support.<h2>Consult a clairvoyant specialized in tarology to apprehend your future<\/h2>\n<em> Cards<\/em> don't lie.

I used to have a complex about my pigmentation spots, but now I feel perfectly fine in my skin, which is in perfect health. I invite you to discover my experience.<!--more--><h2>Living in the South of France, I was often exposed to the sun<\/h2>\nAh the South! I have always lived there and I really enjoy it. I particularly appreciate the climate that reigns there since the <strong>sun<\/strong> is almost omnipresent. I love to feel the sun's rays caressing my skin and when I was younger, I was envied for my pretty complexion, but I made the mistake of believing that my skin was used to UV rays and that elaborate creams for sun protection were unnecessary. As a result, my beautiful tan gave way to brown spots.<h2>This excessive sun exposure caused many brown spots to appear on my skin<\/h2>\n <strong>Skin pigmentation<\/strong> is a natural process during which the body synthesizes melanin. This melanin spreads evenly over the body, creating natural pigmentation. However, excessive sun exposure disrupts this process, which is called melanogenesis. The pigment is no longer distributed evenly. Darker pigment spots appear here and there. As I have personally experienced, the areas most exposed to the sun are more vulnerable. I've mainly noticed brown patches on my face and arms, but also on my legs, back and hands.<h2>These pigment spots became problematic and unattractive<\/h2>\nI had thought that my pigmentation problem would disappear on its own if I got into the habit of applying sun protection before going out, even if it was just to lounge around in my garden. Unfortunately, this was not the case. On the contrary, the appearance of<strong> spots<\/strong> increased over the years, making my skin look dirty in places. I looked constantly tired and honestly, it was not a pretty sight, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.freenewstv.fr\/que-faire-contre-les-insomnies\/\">I even had insomnia<\/a>! When you live in the South, light clothing and outdoor days are a great prospect. But I gave it up, too complexed by my appearance.<h2>I tried all sorts of skin creams, but they had no effect<\/h2>\nFighting brown spots became a top priority because I felt bad about myself. I was embarrassed to be stared at and curious about it. I was also afraid that the pigmentation disorder would lead to some kind of disease. So I did a lot of research on the internet and tried all the supposedly miraculous creams I could find. I must admit that I spent a small fortune to try to reduce this too dark <strong>pigment<\/strong>. It was a waste of time. The brown spots were still there.<h2>A beautician finally advised me to have a laser treatment<\/h2>\n[caption id=\"attachment_804\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1920\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/ekr39ogz.freenewstv.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/laser-taches-brunes-scaled.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-804 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/ekr39ogz.freenewstv.fr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/laser-taches-brunes-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"L'utilisation du laser est tr\u00e8s efficace contre les t\u00e2ches brunes !\" width=\"1920\" height=\"2560\" \/><\/a> Using the laser is very effective against brown spots![\/caption] During a beauty and wellness session, I discussed my complex with my esthetician. I asked her what solution would really be effective against pigmentation spots. She advised me to consult a <strong>beauty clinic<\/strong> and consider laser treatment. I clicked on the word \"beauty clinic\" because I had not yet considered the medical approach. I was grateful to my esthetician for this valuable advice, which I promised myself to follow as soon as possible.<h2>I asked about this treatment and was reassured!<\/h2>\nAs you can imagine, I had a lot of questions: is it painful? Does it leave unsightly scars? How long does it take for the spots to disappear or at least to fade? Is the treatment suitable for all skin types? I found all the answers I needed by consulting the website of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.centrelasernice.fr\/\">aesthetic clinic Le Verdun<\/a>, which my aesthetician had told me about. Before the first session, a medical team will take care of you and establish a diagnosis. This makes it possible to determine the treatment plan adapted to the characteristics of the skin.<h2>The operation went perfectly, today my skin is radiant!<\/h2>\nAfter the treatment, scabs formed and fell off by themselves but did not leave any unsightly <strong>scars<\/strong>. Following the doctor's advice, I applied a skin protector every day for the first few days and I slowed down on sun exposure, because ultraviolet rays can cause a pigmentary rebound. At the same time, the appearance of spots is quite common under the effect of old age, or rather the aging of skin cells. Yes, I have encountered problems with brown spots but I have found an effective solution. The laser treatment carried out on a case-by-case basis in a medical center has proven to be effective and safe. To preserve the effects and in anticipation of skin aging, I protect my skin better!"},"translate-46":{"url":"numerologie-gratuite","title":"Free numerology : is it really reliable ?","h1":"The point on free numerology and its effectiveness!","contenu":"Astrology has always accompanied human beings throughout civilizations, who have always been interested in the science of the stars to move around on the sea and on Earth, but also to find<strong> revealing signs about their future.<\/strong> Through a rich mix of sciences, numerology was born.<!--more-->Thanks to numerous methods,<strong> numerology <\/strong>is still used today to predict the future, whether in terms of love, work, and even dating.
