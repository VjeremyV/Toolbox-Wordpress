One of them is the ecological bonus imposed by the President of the Republic for individuals who embark on the purchase of 100% electric cars. In this article, we will tell you about this ecological bonus and its estimate in 2022.<h2>What is the electric car bonus?<\/h2>\nThe electric car bonus or also called <strong>the ecological bonus<\/strong> is an amount offered by the state and estimated by the President of the Republic Mr. Emmanuel Macron. The principle of this bonus is simply to<strong>help the buyers <\/strong>or lessees of non-polluting cars such as electric vehicles. The estimation<strong> can change from one year to another <\/strong>depending on the decision of the decree and also on the level of CO2 emissions of the cars. In 2022 the electric car premium was 6,000 euros and this until December 31, 2022.<h2>What vehicles and criteria do I need to have to benefit from this bonus?<\/h2>\nThe electric model exists in <strong>several forms<\/strong> and <strong>types of vehicles<\/strong>, but you should know that <strong>the French state does not exclude any of<\/strong> them and all are entitled to this premium namely:<ul>\n \t<li>Plug-in hybrid cars;<\/li>\n \t<li>private electric cars;<\/li>\n \t<li>quadricycles;<\/li>\n \t<li>electric motorcycles and scooters.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nThe most important thing is not the type of electric vehicle you have, but <strong>the criteria you have to meet<\/strong>. First of all, for cars with four wheels, the income conditions are not taken into consideration and the bonus is automatically granted. But you must still be a <strong>French resident<\/strong>. For the vehicle, it must be bought or leased<strong> for at least 2 years<\/strong>, so it must not be sold before this period and your <strong>registration must be French <\/strong>.<h2>Estimating the ecological premium for electric trucks and buses<\/h2>\nTrucks and buses are different from electric cars since they are heavy trucks. Thus, their premium can be different in its estimation. The state offers <strong>an aid of 40% of the purchase price of the vehicle<\/strong>. Here is a more detailed explanation:<ul>\n \t<li>an estimate of 30,000 euros for a bus type M2 OR M3 ;<\/li>\n \t<li>an estimate of 50,000 euros for trucks of the N2 or N3 type.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nAs for cars, the premium amounts are announced at the beginning of each year. It is possible that they will be lowered on January 1, 2023.<h2>The estimate of the electric bonus for bicycles<\/h2>\nAs mentioned above, the state does not exclude any electric vehicle and even bicycles with assistance. These benefit from an amount estimated to their CO2 emissions in the air and also<strong> to the tax income<\/strong> of their owners and which is <strong>equal to 200 euros of<\/strong> ecological <strong>bonus<\/strong>. There is an ecological bonus for individuals with electric bicycles fitted out that transport goods or people. The bonus can go<strong> up to 40% of the price of the bike <\/strong>.<h2>How to get your ecological bonus?<\/h2>\nGenerally, you can <strong>obtain your ecological bonus <\/strong>for the purchase or lease of an electric vehicle quickly if your dealer makes the advance payment of the bonus himself and this will save you the trouble of doing the procedure yourself. But in other cases the dealer may refuse to make the advance payment of the bonus himself and so you will have to do it yourself, this may take a little more time. First you have to fill in a form with the agency in charge of the ecological payments. But you should know that it should<strong> not exceed 6 months<\/strong> after the date of purchase of the vehicle. And for the leasing of a vehicle, it is the same thing, you should not exceed 6 months, but from the <strong>date of the first payment<\/strong> with the dealer. To conclude, the premium for electric cars in 2022 is estimated at 6,000 euros until December 31, 2022 and will certainly decrease on January 1, 2023.

The market share of hybrid vehicle registrations has risen from 24.8 percent to 29.4 percent. In France, this market is booming with very attractive sales figures and financial aid granted to people wanting to buy a hybrid car. <strong>Which hybrid car to choose in 2022<\/strong>? Let's take a look.<h2>What is a hybrid vehicle?<\/h2>\nContrary to a gasoline or diesel car, a hybrid car is a car equipped with a thermal engine and an electric engine. It is equipped with a gasoline engine (thermal), one or more electric motors and a battery. If you're wondering why you might want to <strong>buy a hybrid car in 2022<\/strong>, you should know that hybrid cars are designed to be environmentally friendly. Thanks to the engines and battery, a hybrid car uses both electrical and thermal energy to operate while reducing CO2 emissions. It is also economical in the sense that it allows the owner to reduce fuel costs. In France, the government supports the purchase of this type of vehicle as part of the environmental prevention strategy by offering financial aid to those interested. In fact, a bonus of 1,000 euros offered to those wishing to buy a rechargeable car is currently extended until the end of December 2022. This bonus is part of the government's plan to boost the car market in France after the health crisis.<h2>Which hybrid car to choose?<\/h2>\nIf you're looking for <strong>the best 2022 hybrid car <\/strong>on the market right now, you should know that you'll be spoilt for choice. In fact, several cars in hybrid versions have entered the market in the last couple of years. Among the hybrid cars, we can mention :<ul>\n \t<li>the Audi A3, A6, A7 and Q7;<\/li>\n \t<li>the BMW X1, X3 ;<\/li>\n \t<li>the Mercedes GLC ;<\/li>\n \t<li>the Peugeot 3008;<\/li>\n \t<li>the Opel Grandland;<\/li>\n \t<li>the Ford Kuga ;<\/li>\n \t<li>the Volvo XC40 ;<\/li>\n \t<li>the Citro\u00ebn C5 Aircross ;<\/li>\n \t<li>the Renault Captur and M\u00e9gane Estate ;<\/li>\n \t<li>the Kia Ceed SW and XCeed;<\/li>\n \t<li>the Toyota RAV4, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV, best hybrid in 2022<\/h3>\nVery easy to recharge and characterized by low CO2 emissions, this plug-in hybrid is the<strong>best-selling hybrid vehicle<\/strong> in<strong>2022<\/strong> in France and Europe. Recognized for its lower than average maintenance costs, the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV recharges in 25 minutes, has a fuel consumption of 3.2 l\/100 km and a 10-year warranty (160,000 km). The 100% hybrid electric\/gasoline engine vehicle offers its owner a unique experience, maximum power and guaranteed efficiency. German manufacturers are the leaders in hybrid technology in the French and European market, as the largest number of hybrid vehicle models are designed by BMW, Mercedes, Porsche and Volkswagen. Other car brands such as Toyota, Lexus, Honda, Kia and Land Rover have launched good hybrid vehicles that are distinguished by various features.<h2>What is the difference between a simple hybrid and a plug-in hybrid?<\/h2>\nRange is the first point of distinction between <strong>a plug-in hybrid <\/strong>and a non-plug-in hybrid. A plug-in hybrid car has a range of 20 to 60 kWh and a top speed of about 120 km\/h. The non-plug-in hybrid car has a limited range. It can drive in the city for only a few kilometers. Its battery is of low capacity, around one kWh, and is recovered through two processes, either via the thermal engine or through a braking system that allows energy to be recovered while braking. The kinetic energy recovery device during braking is specific to electric and hybrid cars. There are other differences between the two cars in terms of technology, price, usage and sales volume. In the case of a plug-in hybrid, when the range values are exceeded while driving, the combustion engine takes over to extend the range. The way a hybrid car is charged is the same as for an electric car. It is recharged at a charging station or a domestic socket."},"translate-3":{"url":"mandatory-car-device-2022","title":"Mandatory car device in 2022: we tell you everything","h1":"Presentation of the new mandatory devices for cars in 2022","contenu":"European Union authorities have approved plans to expand the list of mandatory equipment for new cars.

The objective is clear: to make the team a fully-fledged team, capable of competing with the best, and to do so, the team has made many changes both on the technical and sporting levels. The Renault E-Tech 20 engine from 2020, which equipped the single-seaters at the time, has been replaced by a more powerful and reliable engine. Engineers have also worked hard to refine the car's aerodynamics, with the aim of improving its racing behavior. On the sporting side, the team has achieved a real coup by bringing Fernando <strong>Alonso<\/strong> back to Formula 1.

In addition, Alpine has also signed an agreement with French company Total Energies to supply high-performance fuels and lubricants, while other partners such as Microsoft, Richard Mille and Bell &amp; Ross are supporting the French team and contributing to its international reputation. These strategic alliances are essential to ensure the long-term success of the Alpine team. The Alpine team entered a new era in 2021, with the return of Fernando Alonso and the adoption of the Alpine name. Since then, the French team has continued to make progress and demonstrate its ambition to return to the top of the Formula 1 <strong>world championship<\/strong>. To achieve this, the team led by Laurent Rossi can count on its talented drivers, Fernando Alonso and Esteban Ocon, but also on a solid organization, strategic partnerships and the unfailing support of its fans.
