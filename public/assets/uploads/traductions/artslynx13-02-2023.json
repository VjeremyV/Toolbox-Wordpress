Auctions are highly regulated transactions, and like many specific fields, they benefit from a precise vocabulary of their own. To familiarize yourself with these words and be efficient in your dealings, let's take a look at some of the terms you might encounter if you enter the auction world.<!--more--><h2>What you need to know about auctions<\/h2>\n <strong>Auctions<\/strong> can be voluntary, meaning that they are initiated by the seller: a collection of objects, a bulky inheritance... The owner of the goods wishes to recover liquidity on his personal property, so he entrusts them to an auctioneer. The auctioneers know the <em>art market<\/em>, for example, and the prices charged. They are therefore the most capable of advising and guiding the seller on what he can get for his items. You can contact an auctioneer directly in an auction room (you can easily find the rooms near you on the internet), also called a voluntary sales company. The auction can be judicial: the sale is forced, and undergone by the seller. A judge will decide that a company in liquidation or a private individual in bankruptcy (i.e. who can no longer honor his debts) will sell his goods to reimburse his <em>creditor<\/em>. This is often the case for real estate transactions for which mortgages had been the chosen guarantees, or sales of professional equipment. In case of surplus, the sellers will keep the difference. As a buyer, for real estate transactions, you must be assisted by a lawyer registered at the bar. Any good can be sold at auction: real estate, stamps, works of art, plumbing, furniture, etc. Almost anything. The regulations provide for prohibitions in terms of security, animal and environmental protection (endangered species, ivory), ethics (mummified human remains, Nazi objects) ... But these rules are national and vary by country.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hdvnice.com\/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-653 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/0eg9771n.artslynx.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/enchere-marteau.jpg\" alt=\"enchere marteau\" width=\"640\" height=\"355\" \/><\/a>\n<h2>The vocabulary to know<\/h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Successful bidder: this is the person or company that wins the auction, the one whose price was the highest.<\/li>\n \t<li>Auction: this is the legal term for putting an item up for sale by auction. It is called \"sale by auction\".<\/li>\n \t<li><em>Adjudicated<\/em>: this is the magic word! It is a very important word which means that the auction is won by the last bidder. This word acts as the adjudication and the transfer of ownership. A single hammer blow simply stops the <em>sale<\/em>.<\/li>\n \t<li>Sale catalog : this is the list of goods that will be offered. It is mainly published for prestigious art sales and is often paid for.<\/li>\n \t<li>Deposit: this is an authorisation to draw down money to be signed when you bid for the first time.<\/li>\n \t<li>Candlelight: a system where the <strong>bidding<\/strong> stops when the candle goes out. It's a small flame rather than a large candle.<\/li>\n \t<li>Consignment: for real estate sales, bidders must deposit a check in consignment with the notary in charge of the sale. He will determine the amount. Remember that it is not possible to take out a bank loan to buy a property at auction, you must pay cash.<\/li>\n \t<li>Bidding: it is to propose a higher offer than that of another buyer.<\/li>\n \t<li>Bidder: you must be of age, solvent... and not prohibited from selling at auction! In the context of a real estate auction, only a lawyer can bid on behalf of his client. Similarly, you cannot bid on your own property.<\/li>\n \t<li>Crazy bidding: this is a sale during which a property that had been sold at a previous sale is auctioned off, and the buyer has withdrawn (he\/she suffers financial penalties: difference with the new sale price, cost of the auction...). This is called re-bidding.<\/li>\n \t<li>Fees: be careful, in addition to the hammer price, you will have to pay fees. They are publicly announced and vary from 15 to 25%.<\/li>\n \t<li>Reserve price: this is the price below which the auctioneer commits to the seller not to sell the property. It is usually kept secret. Overbidding: after a real estate sale, there is a 10-day period during which a buyer can still propose a price that is at least 10% higher than the winning bid.<\/li>\n \t<li>Private sale: if a property does not find a buyer during a sale (no bidder or reserve price not reached), auctioneers now have the possibility to proceed to a private sale, outside the traditional auction circuit. They are also called \"aftersales\".<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nAuctions can be a real way to make good deals. However, to succeed in your auctions, it is better to be at least informed about the principle of the sale you are going to attend, so as not to be in default of payment (beware of additional costs) and to be well informed about the goods put up for sale so as not to buy above their value in the excitement of the auction."},"translate-1":{"url":"how-to-carry-bracelet-summer","title":"Anklet: the perfect summer jewel!","h1":"How to wear the ankle bracelet this summer?","contenu":"<h1><\/h1>\nWith the beautiful days coming back, there is only one thing to do: go out in the fresh air!

An anklet, as its name suggests, is worn on the ankle. But behind this simple name, there is a wide variety of styles and materials. According to archaeologists and ethnologists, the anklet appeared around 1800 BC on the banks of the Danube in the Alps. Sumptuous anklets, adorned with precious stones, connected to toe rings, have also been found in tombs in ancient Egypt. In Egypt, and throughout the ancient East, they were often the prerogative of prostitutes, male or female. The reason is simple: an anklet gives a very sensual walk. But that's not all. Throughout the ages and around the world, anklets also symbolized a certain social status: made of gold and adorned with precious stones, they showed the wealth of their owners. Our modern era has definitely adopted the anklet, as a piece of jewelry with character that enhances the beautiful legs. Nowadays, many <em>designers<\/em> give very different designs to the anklet, so that each, or everyone, will find the bracelet that will please him or her the most. The anklet can be discreet, glamorous, ethnic, precious or fancy, everything is possible. What is certain is that it is chosen with care, to reflect absolutely the personality and tastes of its owner. In any case, it is a <strong>piece of costume jewelry for women<\/strong> absolutely essential, especially in summer. Find the most beautiful models available on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mylittlefantaisie.com\/12-bijoux-femme\">this site<\/a>.<h2>What is their original function?<\/h2>\nIn India, the anklet is exclusively worn by women. A symbol of femininity and tradition, it is often linked with a toe ring, and gives a lot of grace to the walk of the one who wears it. It is sometimes an assembly of very fine<em>rings<\/em>, or it is an elaborate chain decorated with pendants. Precious and heavy, it was one of the essential elements of the bride's finery on her wedding day. In Asia and Africa too, the anklet was most often the prerogative of women. It was often worn in pairs. Made of gold or silver, this type of anklet showed a certain social status. Some did not even have a clasp and, soldered, were worn for life. In Africa, the anklet, often made of bronze or engraved brass, was worn during festivals, initiation rites and funerals. It was a symbolic treasure, which was passed on from generation to generation, and protected its holder. But it was also a treasure in the true sense of the word: made of aluminum, silver or gold, they reflected the wealth of the family. They were sometimes part of the dowry for the bride, or were the gift that the young fianc\u00e9 had to give to his bride, in order to consider marrying her. Sometimes, the anklet was also used as a kind of talisman, to protect loved ones. This is how it was worn by young Chinese children to ward off evil spirits. These models, made of metal, silver or even gold, often had small bells, which also allowed to know where the child was... Because the anklet can be musical. Decorated with charms or small bells, it was often the prerogative of dancers, whether in India, Asia or Africa. Their tinkling added to the dynamism and magic of traditional dances.<h2>With which clothes should I wear the anklet?<\/h2>\nThe anklet can be worn with shoes and outfits. A gold anklet will go perfectly with pretty black patent pumps, or very classic Salom\u00e9 shoes, while a braided anklet with <strong>charms<\/strong> will be perfect for sandals, or beach flip-flops. You are a bridesmaid for a wedding: with a light and classic dress, made of airy veils, opt for a chic anklet, a simple gold <em>chain <\/em>. You are going for a ride on the beach: a hemp or cotton braided bracelet will be ideal with brown, beige or orange colored clothes. You're out for a nightcap at the beach bar: a fancy silver chain, embellished with summer charms, will be perfect for dancing on your ankle. In all cases, the anklet should add something extra, and not steal the show from your outfit. It must therefore be coordinated with the rest of your clothes and accessories (other jewelry, shoes, handbag). It should also match your character, so that you can wear your ankle chain easily on any occasion: whether you are classic or casual, shy or absolutely glamorous, there is bound to be an ankle chain for you. The ankle bracelet should also fit your physique, to enhance it. Strong calves will prefer chains or braids that are a little thick, and will bet on varied colors and dancing charms. While slender ankles can opt for very thin metal chains, almost airy, with subtle reflections. Sportswomen will be careful to choose strong anklets. In all cases, the feet should be perfectly moisturized, and the nails should be well cared for.<h2>Current styles of anklets<\/h2>\nIn meaning as in look, the anklet has evolved well since ancient times. While it has lost none of its sensuality, the anklet is now primarily a fashion accessory, and a symbol of good times. Since the late 20th century, and today more than ever, the anklet is worn worldwide as a fashion accessory. It has a clasp. It is therefore able to change with the seasons and desires. It asserts an originality, a<strong> style<\/strong>, it makes us feel beautiful, from head to toe. It blooms in the beautiful days, when we start to show our legs. Today, all styles of anklets are possible. The designers have completely seized this jewel, and it is declined in an infinity of colors and materials. It can be in fancy metal, silver, gold plated or gold. Some anklets are rigid, others are flexible. An anklet can be made of plastic, nylon, cotton or leather. It can be braided, tied with charms or<em> engraved<\/em>. It can be very classic, very chic, or a bit bohemian.<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-668\" src=\"http:\/\/0eg9771n.artslynx.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/bracelet-de-cheville.jpg\" alt=\"bracelet de cheville\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" \/><em>We love bohemian anklets.<\/em>The charms can be metallic, or made of feathers, pearls or shells. There is something for every taste, and every budget! What matters is its meaning, and its beauty. The anklet has simply become a fashion accessory very current. It adapts to all desires, it is able to accessorize all outfits.<h2>Wear it alone or in accumulation?<\/h2>\nAn anklet can be worn alone. It will attract all eyes. But it can also follow the fashion of \"stacking\", that of an accumulation of jewels, like a collection, a series of memories, a talisman: we then wear several on the same ankle. It is a matter of taste and morphology. You will know how to find the anklet(s) that will highlight you, and attract the eye on your pretty legs.<h2>Can it be associated with other types of jewelry?<\/h2>\nLike all jewelry, and like all <strong>fashion<\/strong> accessories, the anklet can be associated, and even matched, with your other jewelry, such as necklace or earrings. You will feel beautiful from head to toe! So, for example, if your anklet is a delicate metal chain, don't pair it with a thick fabric or pearl necklace: both of these pieces of jewelry will lose their shine. Another example, if your earrings have pretty shell pendants, go for an anklet with charms that remind you of the beach, with palm trees, fish, starfish, or shells... Matching, as always, will be the little extra touch of magic to your outfits. You will feel so beautiful! The anklet symbolizes a certain desire for freedom. The desire to enjoy the sun, the desire to show your legs. It adds style and sensuality to any outfit. It would be wrong to be deprived of it. For a perfect look to the tip of your feet, choose your anklet!"},"translate-2":{"url":"comment-realiser-bracelet-bresilien-debutant","title":"Brazilian bracelet: our guide for beginners","h1":"How to make a Brazilian bracelet when you are a beginner ?","contenu":"A favorite pastime of teenagers, making a Brazilian bracelet is easy and allows you to create the must-have accessory of your summers.

These are easily found and come in all ranges of colors, there are even fluorescent ones! The principle is to make a knot on a support thread, from left to right and then from right to left. Different knots are used: the right side stitch, the reverse stitch and also the reverse\/right side stitch.<h2>\nTips to start your bracelet<\/h2>\nFirst of all, choose threads of different colors, knowing that the more you have, the thicker your bracelet will be. Cut the length of an arm (about 90cm), or double it if you use only a few colors. Tie the threads, leaving about ten centimeters before the knot to be able to make a braid. You can hold them in place by inserting a safety pin in the <strong>knot<\/strong> and then hanging it on your pants. You can also use a very strong scotch tape or insert them in the lid of a box that you will then wedge between your knees.<h2>The different steps of the making<\/h2>\n <strong>Making<\/strong> a bracelet is simple, and requires just a little attention! Hold the fixed wires with one hand, and make the knot with the other hand. The principle is to knot one thread on all the others, changing the direction of the knots to create patterns. You need a minimum of <em>2 threads<\/em>: - at least 1 thread that remains fixed - 1 thread that surrounds the other(s) Spread out all the threads in a fan, take the outer thread that you will knot on each of the other threads.<h2><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-675\" src=\"http:\/\/0eg9771n.artslynx.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/realisation-bracelet-bresilien.jpg\" alt=\"realisation bracelet bresilien\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\" \/><\/h2>\n<h2>\nThe different types of Brazilian bracelets<\/h2>\nThere are several types of bracelets: The round ones, for which only the right knot is necessary.

Herringbone bracelets or bracelets that are a little more complex: the right side knot is used but also the reverse knot to create different patterns. When your bracelet is finished, you can finish it by tying the last strands together and then knotting them directly on the wrist.

Let's take a look at the creole earrings adapted to the <strong>male<\/strong> gender.<!--more--><h2>Creole earrings: definition<\/h2>\nCreole earrings are ring-shaped earrings. If they are always circular, their thickness and width can vary from one model to another. There are also hoop earrings in different materials, the finish can be smooth or with patterns \/ textures.

You will surely find your happiness.<h2>The origin and history of creole earrings<\/h2>\nThe <em>origins<\/em> of Creole earrings are not precise but archaeological excavations have uncovered<strong> rings<\/strong> dating back to 2600 years BC. These earrings were found in the territory of present-day Iraq, in the heart of Sumerian tombs.<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-704\" src=\"http:\/\/0eg9771n.artslynx.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/boucle-oreille-creole-homme.jpg\" alt=\"boucle oreille creole homme\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" \/>Creoles seem to have originated in the Nubian civilization that occupied the territory we know today as Sudan. It also seems that men and women wore creoles in ancient Egypt. Earrings were worn as amulets to protect the wearer and could also be seen as signs of wealth and <strong>accessories<\/strong> to enhance the beauty of the wearer. Pharaohs such as Hatshepsut and Tutankhamen wore creoles as ornaments. They kept their jewelry after their death to maintain their sex appeal during their existence in the afterlife. During the period of slavery, creoles were the only personal jewelry allowed. Since slaves were usually deported, their rings symbolized their attachment to their homelands, which were mostly located around the coast of Africa. This probably gave the name to the creole earrings, which were a powerful symbol of identity. Later, men in the navy adopted the creoles as a way to forge their own identity. In the 1960's, it was more African American women who incorporated the creole earrings into their jewelry boxes. The rings were then a strong symbol of their origins, which they proudly assumed. Men wearing creoles began to be rare, as these rings were often associated with bad <em>boys<\/em>. Times have changed, however, and men's creoles have become fashion phenomena as well as identity accessories. Jewelry has become more modern, as the work on metals has become more precise and refined. Just as women's jewelry comes in a variety of styles, men's jewelry has a much higher standard. You'll find designs, sizes and shapes that allow you to make a statement without necessarily looking like a bad boy (unless that's your goal, of course). You just have to find the right ring.<h2>Balinese hoop earrings for men<\/h2>\nThese creoles reflect<strong> Balinese<\/strong> craftsmanship to perfection. They are usually made of silver voluntarily oxidized, which results in a color mixing gray and black, in a finish that plays between the matte and shiny. Most of the time, these rings have twists that give it an exotic touch suitable for all styles. If you are a fan of the adventurous style or if you usually wear outfits with bohemian accents, Balinese creoles are made for you. Don't hesitate to compare the different designs presented on specialized websites to find the perfect earring.<h2>Steel creole earring for men<\/h2>\n<strong>Steel<\/strong> gives birth to undeniably contemporary jewelry, which can be combined without any difficulty with your favorite look. Available in black or gray, your earring can have a smooth finish, intricate textures, printed patterns... It's the perfect piece of jewelry to make you stand out with a bold, modern edge. Steel hoop earrings can be as extravagant as they are understated. Once again, take the time to compare the models.<h2>Men's creole earrings in black<\/h2>\nBlack earrings are often made of stainless steel or silver. Some models are worked with extreme finesse, others have a great thickness but in any case, it is impossible for you to go unnoticed with such <strong>jewelry<\/strong>. The black rings have a provocative side that is very much appreciated by men with strong personalities, so if you are not a fan of conformity, these are creoles that have everything you need to please. These men's earrings complement gothic, punk and rock looks to perfection.<h2>Tribal men's creole earrings<\/h2>\nTribal style creoles are relatively similar to Balinese rings in that they benefit from artistic oxidation that blackens certain parts of the jewelry. As their name suggests, these earrings for men feature tribal motifs, which makes them jewelry with a very marked virility. The details are worked with great care, which allows to juggle between a certain originality and a refinement without concession.<h2>Creole earring man crimped<\/h2>\nThe time when crimped jewelry was reserved for the ladies is well and truly over. Zirconium, onyx and many other stones cut in a multitude of shapes now come to dress the earrings for men. Shiny stones are more eye-catching as they sparkle in the light, while matte stones add a more subtle touch of fantasy. So see which design makes you feel more comfortable.<h2>Ethnic men's creole earrings<\/h2>\nThese men's rings honor the know-how of different ethnic groups from Bali, African countries or America... Their charm lies mainly in the ornaments they are adorned with, including decorative balls and twists that can be sleek or sophisticated. Ethnic rings usually have a smooth appearance coupled with some reliefs skillfully integrated by designers. This design gives them an elegance that allows them to match any look without ever standing out.<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-705\" src=\"http:\/\/0eg9771n.artslynx.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/boucle-doreille-creole-homme.jpg\" alt=\"boucle doreille creole homme\" width=\"460\" height=\"690\" \/><h2>Two-tone creole earring for men<\/h2>\nWant to be<em> fancy<\/em> but not too fancy? The two-tone rings answer your desires. They often feature patterns in a different color than the jewelry itself. You can choose between very marked nuances and more discreet notes, in the same way that the designs of two-tone earrings can be original to the extreme as they can be aligned with a very classic<strong> style<\/strong>.<h2>Men's creole earrings with scales<\/h2>\nWorked in tribal spirit, these earrings for men have a very affirmed style. The scales are often chiseled out of steel, creating textures and shades of color that effortlessly modernize your look. Contrary to popular belief, this type of earring can be adapted to any <em>outfit <\/em>: classic, sporty, casual...

Choose a cross, a star, a hand, a feather, an astrological sign, an ideogram... A wide variety of ornaments is available. Each pendant can have a particular meaning that will help you make the right choice. You can also be guided by your desires of the moment. The creoles for men exist in an infinite number of variations as attractive as each other. The right choice depends on the identity and style you want to assert. For that, be interested in the designs as much as in the metals used. The easiest way is to choose your rings from an online jewelry store that offers you visibility on all the available options.

After some time, the perfect selection appeared to you: a combination of paintings, <strong>sculptures<\/strong> and lithographs is the result of your search for inspiration. You may have a place for your sculptures, but you don't yet know how to organize the hanging of your <em>paintings<\/em> and prints. Speaking of hanging, you don't know how to frame them either! Between those that are very colorful, those with a particular texture and those painted on an original support, you wonder how to achieve the perfect framing. The custom frame should not distort the works of art, but highlight them. However, this does not mean that the frame has to be neutral or even bland. You can have fun with the many possibilities that custom frames offer, to create one that has personality and that enhances your work at the same time. We've prepared a few tips on how to achieve such a <strong>frame<\/strong> and give your artwork the best framing experience!<h2>1. The American box<\/h2>\nWhen it comes to<em>artworks<\/em>, the custom frame par excellence is the <a href=\"https:\/\/lamafactory.com\/fr\/caisse-americaine\">American box<\/a>! This \"open\" framing technique puts the canvas at the heart of the subject. With its lack of protective glass, the American box creates a striking proximity between the work and the person who looks at it. The space left between the canvas and the edge of the frame also contributes to this effect, giving the impression that the work is coming out of the frame. With a frame like this, you'll have to keep your guests from putting their fingers on your canvas!<h2>2. A different mounting for each work<\/h2>\nIf you choose a frame other than an <strong>American crate<\/strong>, then you can play around with the different types of mounting. For a canvas that is painted and has a lot of relief, look into the deep mounting. This mount puts a greater distance between the bottom of the frame, and therefore your work, and the protective glass. For example, for a<em> Van Gogh painting<\/em> with a very textured look, opt for this mount. It will perfectly highlight the brushstrokes and impastos so appreciated by the<em>artist<\/em>. For a work painted on an original paper, opt for the floating mount. Indeed, if the paper of the work has a large grain, this mounting will allow to highlight it by slightly raising the subject within the frame. When the edge of the paper is irregular and has rough edges, don't hide it! This conscious choice by the artist is an integral part of the work. Again, the floating mount will give the canvas an airy look and the edges of the canvas will be more prominent than ever [caption id=\"attachment_710\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"715\"]<img class=\" wp-image-710\" src=\"http:\/\/0eg9771n.artslynx.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/tableau-encadrement.jpg\" alt=\"tableau encadrement\" width=\"715\" height=\"1073\" \/> Framing[\/caption]<h2>3. A frame with a different stick for each canvas<\/h2>\nFinally, to complete the look of your artwork, play with the colors of the frame. Choose a color that dominates within your canvas and adopt the same for the frame. You will obtain a monochrome atmosphere that can emphasize the importance of the color used. Do not hesitate to add a mat to avoid the overloaded effect. For a canvas with dark colors, you can accentuate the effect by opting for a black frame with an intense color. Also, you can let the work stand out naturally by placing it in a sober and minimalist frame. Conversely, a gilded and ornamented frame can retranscribe the spirit of an old painting and create a retro atmosphere around a modern work."}}
