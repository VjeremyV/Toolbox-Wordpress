In addition to the usual checks on its overall aesthetics and details and the proper functioning of each of its facilities, you must ensure that no unpleasant surprises await you afterwards. Here are a few tips to help you make your purchase with a minimum of worry.<!--more--><h2><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-715\" src=\"http:\/\/5s44y58e.cnpas.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/facade.jpg\" alt=\"facade\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" \/>\n\nKnow all the costs related to the purchase of the apartment<\/h2>\nIn addition to the initial cost announced by the real estate agency or the private individual with whom you deal directly, inform yourself about the additional costs related to the purchase of your future apartment. It is indeed important to take everything into account, from the renovation work to be considered to the cost necessary for the slightest repair that you will be obliged to make. Taken separately, each of these points may seem trivial. But when you put them all together, you may end up with a bill that is much larger than the budget you originally planned to spend on your purchase. For example, you will have to think about cleaning the premises if your future apartment has already been occupied. Calling in a cleaning company is quite possible, but it does of course have an additional cost. In some cases, it will even be necessary to strip and repair certain installations, so many criteria on which you will not be able to make the economy of an intervention. Finally, have a precise idea of the notary fees which are obligatory in any real estate transaction and cannot be reduced. Furthermore, it is not useless to know the local tax rates because they differ from one city to another and can considerably reduce your budget if you have not foreseen the amount. Another expense that you should take into account is the cost of moving, which should also be included in your final budget. This will prevent you from being overwhelmed by expenses that you had not considered, while you were so happy with your new acquisition.<h2>\nKnowing the amount of condominium fees<\/h2>\nApart from the purchase of your apartment, you will also need to know the real expenses that your future home will cost you. Get as much information as possible on the amount of the <strong>condominium<\/strong> fees and do not hesitate to ask other owners who can help you to see more clearly. Make sure you also find out what they really cover so as not to discover other expenses that are not taken into account. In the case of central heating, the charges include this pole. However, this is not the case in all <strong>homes<\/strong>. Water, gas and electricity must therefore be taken into account so that the cost of your apartment, in addition to the purchase, does not explode with exorbitant bills that you had not envisaged. Moreover, who says co-ownership says internal regulations, a document that you must imperatively obtain before signing any commitment whatsoever. The amount of the charges for the two previous years will also be useful in order to have a precise vision of the cost of your future property. In general, they include the <strong>cleaning and maintenance of the common areas<\/strong>. If there is an elevator, check its condition and the date it was put into operation, unless you are moving into a first floor which is not affected by this expense. In any case, if repairs are planned, or if you think that they should be planned in view of the state of the equipment, as the owner you will be primarily concerned. Check carefully the state of the paint in the common areas. If it seems chipped or damaged, it is not excluded that this is an additional area to be <strong>renovated<\/strong>. In any case, the management will provide you with a list of the work that has already been voted on and that will therefore be at your expense when you become the owner. The schedule of calls for funds will also allow you to avoid any unpleasant surprises once you are installed since you will be required to pay the amounts requested. Indeed, in a co-ownership, decisions are voted by a majority during a general assembly and they commit the newcomers even if they did not take part in the vote.<h2>\nAsk if the facade renovation has been carried out<\/h2>\nThe<strong>general exterior condition of the building<\/strong> also deserves your full attention. A defective roof or a shabby facade is not a good sign for a future owner who will have to contribute to the costs of repairing the building. If you have any doubts - which is quite normal, because you can't improvise yourself as a construction specialist - you can call on a professional such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techni-murs.com\/nos-activites\/ravalement\/\">Techni-murs<\/a> in Nates. He will give you his opinion on the <strong>restoration work<\/strong> to be considered, especially if the coating shows signs of weakness that will require an intervention as soon as possible. Poorly done finishing or poorly applied coating and it is all the<strong>waterproofing of the building<\/strong> that can be totally ineffective. Just like poorly insulated windows, a defective fa\u00e7ade can lead to energy losses. It can also result in poor sealing and moisture damage. In order to obtain reliable information, you can consult the minutes of the previous general assemblies and take note of the decisions taken concerning any intervention concerning the fa\u00e7ade and the common parts. Here again, you will avoid having to pay sums that you had not foreseen and which will nevertheless be obligatory. The <em>repair of<\/em> your apartment will already have a cost, so you might as well not have to pay additional costs as soon as you arrive in your new <strong>home<\/strong>. Moreover, having a diagnosis established by a professional will protect you from buying an apartment that could turn out to be a very bad real estate investment.<h2>\nFind out about neighborhood development projects<\/h2>\nIf you think you have finally found the apartment of your dreams, be well informed about the development projects in the neighborhood. You can consult the plans at city hall and find out as much as you can about the land use plan or the public transportation system. A vacant lot or a wooded area that looks a little abandoned is not a good sign. If your windows and terrace look like they could be used for relaxation, it would be a shame to find yourself with a building under construction only a few months after you move in. Likewise, if construction work is planned for several years in your immediate environment, consider how painful it could be before falling for an apartment that you will not enjoy because of noise pollution and construction sites. As much as your apartment will have everything to gain if the neighborhood is modernized and equipped with shops and public transportation, your daily life will undoubtedly be complicated by the various construction sites If you're in it for the long haul, knowing exactly what the future holds for your place of residence can also help you plan your move. If you are in a neighborhood with a lot of character, make sure that your future building is up to code and that work on the facade is not planned to comply with urban planning standards.<h2><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-716\" src=\"http:\/\/5s44y58e.cnpas.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/ravalement-fa\u00e7ade.jpg\" alt=\"ravalement fa\u00e7ade\" width=\"670\" height=\"960\" \/>\n\nMake an inventory of the apartment and its surroundings<\/h2>\nOnce you have made an inventory of the apartment and the surroundings, you can really decide to buy. If you are in love at first sight, don't rush in without having a clear vision of the state of all the exterior. A beautiful apartment in a neglected area will be difficult to resell and may even lose its value over time. By establishing a list of your criteria and priorities, you can approach the purchase of your future apartment with all the cards in hand. Think short, medium and long term. In the short term, you will want to enjoy a pleasant place to live that meets your expectations as soon as possible. This criterion may determine the choice of a turnkey home that you can move into quickly. In the medium term, you can choose a home in a neighborhood that is undergoing major restructuring and where you know that the value of the property will increase in the months or years to come. Finally, if you are looking at the longer term, you can purchase a property in an area that is undergoing a complete overhaul, while being aware of the inconvenience caused by the work involved. A pleasant home is as much about the interior as it is about the living environment that surrounds it. Your ideal home will be in line with your budget, your tastes and your daily habits. Whatever your plans for buying an apartment, find out as much as you can about all the additional costs that can sometimes be overlooked. In addition to your apartment, the condominium fees and the <strong>renovation of the roof and facades<\/strong> will have a cost that you must absolutely take into consideration before signing."},"translate-1":{"url":"tips-maintenance-tracks-mini excavator","title":"Everything you need to know about mini excavator track maintenance","h1":"Our tips for maintaining the tracks of your mini excavator","contenu":"A mini excavator is a construction machine with an articulated arm and a bucket, which is used for earthmoving, excavation and demolition work. Widely used in the construction industry, this particularly maneuverable vehicle needs good tracks to ensure optimal operation. These need to be well maintained so that your equipment is in good working order on the one hand, and resists wear on the other. <!--more-->\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-721\" src=\"http:\/\/5s44y58e.cnpas.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/mini-pelle.jpg\" alt=\"mini pelle\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" \/><h2>How do the tracks work?<\/h2>\nThe chassis of the <strong>mini excavator<\/strong>, which is more or less wide depending on the desired stability, is what supports the rubber tracks. These allow the machine to move forward easily and prevent it from getting stuck in mud or dirt. So how does a mini excavator track work? It is actually a <strong>rubber <\/strong>or steel <strong>chain <\/strong>that forms a loop, which itself runs on rollers. This loop surrounds a frame that has two wheels at its ends: on one side is a driving sprocket wheel called the \"sprocket\" that provides traction, and on the other is a smooth wheel, the \"idler wheel\", that maintains the tension of the track. Between these two ends, rollers guarantee the distribution of the loads and the maintenance of the chain, which is itself guided by stops or \"chain guides\". Rubber pads of different widths and shapes are bolted to the chain depending on the application. A wide range of tracks is available depending on the model and brand of your <strong>machine<\/strong>.<h2>\nWhat are the wear points?<\/h2>\nTrack wear is normal and cannot be avoided. However, it must be uniform, as asymmetrical wear indicates a problem that must be remedied quickly. The cause is probably the pins holding the chain links, as their wear will change the pitch, or spacing. This must be regular and correspond to the teeth of the sprocket. If it is not regular, this defect will itself lead to deterioration of the sprocket. Another point to check every week is the tension of the chain. It should be neither too loose, which would accelerate wear, nor too tight, otherwise it would create tension on the other components. To visually recognize good chain tension, the chain should sag slightly, creating what is called a \"sag\". The ideal amount of sag is indicated by the manufacturer. You can influence the chain tension yourself: to loosen it, empty a small amount of grease with the relief valve. Be careful when unscrewing the relief valve, as it can be thrown out violently by the pressure. To tighten it, push the idler wheel by injecting grease into the <strong>plunger<\/strong>. Inspect the track unit regularly, if possible after each use, to make sure that there is no material trapped inside, such as dirt or other materials. These materials can damage the track over time, or even worse in the event of frost: their expansion can be fatal to your machine. So remember to clean your track every week. Finally, adapt the shoes to the terrain: choose wide shoes with holes for loose soil so that the mud can drain away. On rocky ground, opt for narrow shoes.<h2>\nTake care of your tracks<\/h2>\nA rubber track cannot be repaired. To maximize the life of your tracks, it is important to maintain them and follow a few recommendations. With these tips, your tracks will last a maximum of about two thousand hours. A key factor in keeping your tracks in good condition is to pay close attention to your driving. In rough terrain, drive carefully to avoid bumps that could damage the rubber of the tracks, such as curbs or rocks. Adjust your driving to avoid bumps. Don't drive at an angle over an obstacle or you will create lateral stress that will damage your vehicle. Drive in the direction of the slope, and whenever possible with both tracks on the same level. Also, remember to make wide turns, as counter-rotation will damage your tracks, and don't always turn on the same side, as this will stretch the rubber of the inner track; instead, rotate with both tracks in opposite directions.\n\nBe careful of the surface you are working on, as sharp objects can damage the <strong>tracks<\/strong>, such as flints, construction waste such as scrap metal, etc. Always try to keep your tracks and components clean, especially when they have been in contact with oil or salt. In this case, wipe off the stains immediately after use to avoid corrosion of your equipment. Regularly check that nothing has been inserted into the track guide, as this could damage the links. Prolonged exposure to the sun will contribute to the premature aging of your tool, as will very high heat - above +55\u00baC - or intense cold - below -25\u00baC. Regularly check the tension of the idler wheel. You can keep it taut with the grease nipple located on the side of the undercarriage.<h2><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-720\" src=\"http:\/\/5s44y58e.cnpas.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/chenille-caoutchouc.jpg\" alt=\"chenille caoutchouc\" width=\"1280\" height=\"841\" \/>\nHow do I replace them?<\/h2>\nTracks are not difficult to change. Make sure before buying that they are compatible and adaptable to your machine. Finally, remember to follow all safety instructions to avoid potential accidents. To <strong>replace<\/strong> tracks, you will need a grease gun; it can be manual, electric or pneumatic. You will also need good quality multipurpose grease. You can easily find these items in spare parts at a <strong>construction professional<\/strong> such as or on <a href=\"trconseil.com\">trconseil.com<\/a> specialized online stores. Here are the steps to follow to replace the tracks: first, retract the idler wheel by unscrewing the side grease nipple, you can use a crowbar to do this. Once the idler wheel is retracted, lift your machine onto the blade and bucket. Remove the rubber track, and do the opposite to fix the new one. You will need two people for this step, with one person at the controls of the <strong>vehicle<\/strong> and the other guiding the track in the sprocket with the help of the crowbar. Now put the tensioner back in place, and tension your track with the help of the grease gun. Prefer a vertical movement of 2-3cm in the tension so that your track is neither too tight nor too loose. Now screw the cover back on, and you're done! However, you will need to check the tension after a few hours of use, as a new track always loosens up a little at the beginning. Your mini excavator is now ready, and you know how to regularly maintain the shoes to ensure optimal performance. So what are you waiting for?

This ranges from healthy walks at sunrise, to water sports that guarantee a full day, to gourmet breaks in beach restaurants and more. At the entrance to the city you will find the sandy beach of Bouillabaisse. The place is perfect to watch the boats leaving the port or returning from their sea trips. The Ponche district has two beaches: La Fontanette and La Ponche. The setting is picturesque. Note that these gravel and sand beaches are only accessible on foot. You can reach them from the Citadel or from the port. The Graniers beach seduces by its authentic charm, shaped by a mixture of sand and rocks, shaded here and there by wild vegetation. The crystal-clear water is a delight for bathers who can then enjoy the calmness of the surroundings for a picnic or simply savor the beautiful weather, just a stone's throw from the center of Saint-Tropez. 4 km from the center of Saint-Tropez is enough to reach the Canebiers beach, sometimes called the Canoubiers beach. The sand stretches for nearly 200 meters and umbrella pines provide natural shade. Ramatuelle's beaches are just as popular as those of its neighbor Saint-Tropez. The two towns are separated by only ten kilometers, so you can choose the beach that best suits your desires. Pampelonne is particularly popular with the jet set during the summer season.

Each project calls for different levels of skills because the same construction\/renovation requires interventions in multiple, sometimes interdependent, fields. Missions, training, precautions to take... discover the essentials about the professions in the construction sector.<!--more--><h2>What are the different building trades?<\/h2>\nThe <strong>building and public works <\/strong>sector includes more than thirty professions which essentially allow the realization of real estate or road construction projects. The mason is in charge of building the foundations of the future construction and erecting the walls. The roofer works on the roof. He installs, renovates and repairs it in order to protect the masonry and the occupants of the house against the natural elements (water, snow, wind, sun, etc.). The painter is not satisfied with applying a coat of paint. Upstream work may be necessary, such as sanding and sealing or stripping surfaces from the floor to the ceiling and walls. Next comes the electrician, the professional responsible for the electrical installation. He installs the wiring, sockets and switches. He also connects the electrical appliances (heating, alarm, etc.) to the domestic network. The electrician must imperatively take into account the regulations in force so that your installation is up to standard and therefore safe. The site manager supervises the progress of the <strong>site<\/strong>. He manages the personnel, makes sure that everyone accomplishes their tasks within the given time frame. He also controls the respect of the budget. The site manager is not to be confused with the site supervisor, who ensures that the project is carried out according to plan. The works manager is therefore assigned to manage the resources made available, both in human and technical terms and in terms of the budget. Depending on the size of the project, several teams may be required to work on it. Each team is therefore placed under the supervision of a team leader who acts as an intermediary with the site manager. With the development of new technologies, the profession of Building Information Modeling (BIM) Manager is gaining in importance. This profession focuses on the coordination of work based on the models of the various participants. The BTP engineer plays an essential role since his mission is to develop accurate studies and simulations that will serve as a basis for the project itself. He also draws plans and identifies the most relevant technical processes.<h2>What training is required?<\/h2>\nThe course to follow depends on the job to be done. For example, a vocational training certificate (CAP) or a vocational baccalaureate (bac pro) will enable you to become a bricklayer, roofer, painter or electrician. On the other hand, a vocational training certificate (BTS) or a technical university diploma (DUT) is the minimum required to become a site manager, a works supervisor or a team leader. If you are aiming for the job of BIM manager, you must enroll in an engineering school specializing in this field.<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-732\" src=\"http:\/\/5s44y58e.cnpas.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/vetements-professionnels.jpg\" alt=\"vetements professionnels\" width=\"1281\" height=\"756\" \/>To train as a construction engineer, you need to take a scientific preparatory course. This is a course of study lasting about 2 years, which gives access to a 3-year engineering course. As you can see, you cannot become a building craftsman overnight.<h2>What is the work wear for these professions?<\/h2>\n <strong>Professional clothing<\/strong> can have two purposes: to enhance the image of the company or to protect those who wear it. It seems obvious that the safety aspect is the most important when it comes to the building trades. It is necessary to have a sufficiently robust but comfortable and functional <em>work outfit<\/em>. The <strong>work pants<\/strong> must be meticulously chosen. If the professional has to work on the knees (plumber, electrician...) it is essential to provide reinforcements on the contact areas. If the craftsman has to keep several tools within reach, the presence of several <em>large and robust pockets<\/em> is required. For the top, a T-shirt or sweatshirt may be sufficient if the job excludes the use of sharp tools and\/or contact with dangerous materials. However, a jacket is more appropriate for protection against injury. <em>Coveralls<\/em> offer full protection against dirt. Depending on the material, coveralls can also protect against chemical splashes, burns and injuries. For <strong>safety<\/strong> reasons, coveralls and jackets should not have exposed zippers and\/or buttons that could snag and cause accidents on the job site. It has already been mentioned that work clothes must be <strong>comfortable<\/strong>. Breathable textiles are therefore essential and it is important that the material does not attack the skin due to friction. This is as true for jackets, blouses and other clothing for <em>construction professionals<\/em>. High visibility clothing must be worn by professionals who work at night. The law requires optimal protection. It is therefore mandatory to wear a helmet on construction sites, whether you are an engineer, a mason or a team leader for example. A visor is required for welding operations, and goggles are essential if the craftsman is exposed to projections\/rays. <strong>Safety shoes<\/strong> are also required on construction sites where the risk of impact and crushing is quite high. One can even turn to outfits and accessories specifically for men or choose from a selection for women. Of course, the level of protection must comply with mandatory standards. This is why it's a good idea to go through a company that specializes in the manufacture or sale of protective equipment and <strong>work clothes <\/strong>adapted to the construction sector, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roidutablier.com\/13-vetements-de-travail\">roidutablier.com<\/a>.<h2>What are the essential work tools?<\/h2>\nThe tools depend on the nature of the work to be done. However, there are some multi-purpose materials and equipment that are best kept on hand.<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-733\" src=\"http:\/\/5s44y58e.cnpas.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/pantalon-de-travail.jpg\" alt=\"pantalon de travail\" width=\"1280\" height=\"851\" \/>For destruction, it is important to have a chisel or a drill that can quickly remove tiles and masonry. On the other hand, a jackhammer will be more useful if the structures to be demolished are resistant like concrete. It is also necessary to have cutting tools in order to correctly size the materials before their installation. There is a wide range of saws that can cut metal, plastic, wood.... It is more advantageous to invest in a versatile tool such as a jigsaw and circular saw or a grinder. Obviously, the hand saw remains indispensable not only because of its lightness but also for its ability to cut different types of materials. Construction requires precision. It is therefore necessary to take measurements and there is nothing like a measuring tape to do this. The folding tape measure is made of a rigid material. It combines several segments of 20 cm each with rivets. You only need to unfold the tape measure gradually to take measurements. More compact, the double metal tape measure is rolled up in a case. If it is flexible, its tip has a metal hook that allows you to attach it to the end of the element to be measured and then unroll the tape measure to the desired length. Following the same logic, you need a level that ensures the perfect flatness of the surface. The spirit level is the most commonly used instrument to define the exact angle to be followed. It is used in many different fields such as formwork, tiling, carpentry and more. The rotary laser is also very useful. With a range of up to 50 meters, it allows you to find your way with precision in large spaces, indoors and outdoors. Since most tools are now available in electric versions, it is always interesting to have a generator when you are a construction professional. Indeed, some building sites are not yet connected to the electrical network. If the batteries of the machines and tools are flat, the work may be delayed. The generator can therefore ensure the charge of the batteries or supply the wired tools. The building trades are demanding. They require solid knowledge drawn from years of training. It is also necessary to comply with safety rules, which requires the choice of a specific <strong>work outfit<\/strong>.

Dynamic and always renewing, this activity has some nice surprises in store for the years to come because, if we are to believe the professionals, it has every intention of offering many jobs in the next three years.<!--more-->[caption id=\"attachment_749\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"650\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-749\" src=\"http:\/\/5s44y58e.cnpas.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/immobilier-entreprise.jpg\" alt=\"immobilier entreprise\" width=\"650\" height=\"366\" \/> real estate business[\/caption]<h2>A job at the heart of a societal issue<\/h2>\nThe importance of real estate can be explained simply by one reason, which is common sense. Everyone needs to find a place to live at some point. Whether you are <strong>renting or buying an apartment<\/strong>, a house or even business premises, this process is always easier and, above all, more efficient by calling on a real estate expert. Spending time looking at advertisements or searching for the perfect property is indeed very time consuming. Moreover, for very specific properties, a real estate agency is undeniably in a good position to manage the transactions. The most recent data show that residential real estate is a sector that does not see its demand decrease. Prestigious villas, properties, castles and mansions are always in demand, as they constitute privileged investments. It is therefore obvious that working in real estate offers a position at the heart of a real societal issue.<h2>A constant need for qualified employees<\/h2>\nIn addition to technical skills and in-depth expertise in the real estate market, many qualifications are required to work in this <em>sector<\/em>. In itself, this field covers multiple skills that must be mastered. A real estate agent, for example, offers his or her services to owners who are planning to rent a <strong>property<\/strong> as well as to people who are looking for a home. This role requires a perfect knowledge of the state of the market, taking into account the local situation. In the case of a sale, it goes without saying that his involvement in this mission is even more specialized. Not only does the real estate professional select the properties that he offers to his clients, but he also handles all aspects of the negotiations. His expert eye is fundamental here since he is expected to find the best products at the best price. In order to do this, he carries out the visits and takes care of the drafting of the sales agreement and the follow-up of the file until its finalization. Moreover, when he works for an <strong>owner<\/strong>, the real estate specialist is also required to estimate the <em>value of the property<\/em> as accurately as possible. All the administrative procedures are thus carried out, which also requires specific skills. But his fields of intervention do not stop there because the new technologies being from now on in the heart of this sector, the qualified employees are also recruited for other qualities. It is indeed essential to be able to make virtual visits, which requires a mastery of computer tools. 3D and 360\u00b0 photographs are now part of a real estate professional's toolbox.<h2>A profession in which there is never a dull moment<\/h2>\nWhether in an agency or as a freelancer, a specialist in real estate transactions carries out an activity from which routine is excluded. Each client is a special case and adaptability is therefore an essential quality. Everything is always a question of nuance and relationship management. If, in theory, a rental or a sale can follow a strict, precise and predefined schedule, in reality, it is important to be attentive to your interlocutor. We are really in a business of real communication, which implies to take into consideration the interlocutors. Listening, dialogue and advice make that each business is different. It is as much to say that one does not get bored by choosing to work in real estate. The spirit of initiative is constantly put to contribution, which allows each person to express his or her personality. If sales techniques are central to the profession, the interest also lies in this freedom of movement. Real estate is constantly evolving, which allows for constant renewal. The notions of management and accounting, which are always welcome in this profession, are coupled with an approach to current events in the sector and its subtleties. Finally, it is an unhoped-for opportunity to discover magical places and exceptional properties. The meeting of demanding interlocutors is in all cases particularly enriching.<h2>A sector of activity in perpetual evolution<\/h2>\nReal estate is an industry in total transformation. Considered as an attractive investment, it adapts to the demands of the customers according to the state of the market. Many customers choose an investment considered as safe in order to diversify their assets. It is thus possible to make financial investments in parallel with the purchase of a principal residence or a second home. In the second case, it can be noted that vacation rentals are growing rapidly, especially in regions dedicated to tourism. It is therefore not uncommon to buy a property and then make it profitable through rental income.<h2>Being in contact with people<\/h2>\nWhat attracts people to the real estate sector are the human relations and the direct contact. Working in this field requires a real sense of listening, as the expectations of the clientele must necessarily be heard. Knowing how to sell does not mean imposing a product at all costs, but rather providing an appropriate response to ensure that the customer is fully satisfied. It is no coincidence that courses such as a real estate Bachelor's degree or a BTS in real estate professions offer this type of approach in their teaching. This relational aspect is indeed essential and it is indispensable to be able to respond to it. Moreover, it is also possible that the search for properties requires canvassing. This more ungrateful part is nevertheless essential in order to prospect a city center or the periphery of a town in order to find new opportunities. Here, everything is a question of tact and diplomacy. Building a network requires time and a way to approach your contacts without annoying them. Door-to-door sales do not consist in harassing owners but on the contrary in approaching them in a friendly and trustworthy way.<h2>A sector with large outlets<\/h2>\nOne of the other attractions of the real estate sector is that it offers a wide range of opportunities. This point is all the more interesting for new applicants for future jobs. In addition, the field is so broad that anyone can find the job that best suits them. Real estate is so diverse that each one calls for specific specializations. The first type of product includes residential properties [caption id=\"attachment_750\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"650\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-750\" src=\"http:\/\/5s44y58e.cnpas.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/entreprise-immobilier.jpg\" alt=\"entreprise immobilier\" width=\"650\" height=\"433\" \/> real estate business[\/caption] This category includes all single-family dwellings, whether they are apartments or houses. Here again, we find all types of housing, from a classic dwelling to exceptional prestigious buildings. The second type of property is real estate itself, which includes all buildings dedicated to industry and logistics, but also office buildings and business premises. This part is therefore just as vast as the previous one, which explains why professionals have to choose an area of intervention. One does not manage a vacation home like a warehouse, each sector responding to very specific constraints. Finally, even if we think less about it at first, the real estate professions are also directly linked to all the public equipment goods such as schools, health establishments or cultural spaces of all kinds. And to finish a panorama tour of a sector with multiple outlets, the places of consumption are also part of the goods which require the intervention of real estate professionals. Leisure or commercial spaces are therefore also properties that can be negotiated by a real estate agent, in the same way as hotels.<h2>Many skills<\/h2>\nA student thinking about his or her future career should carefully consider the strengths of the real estate industry. There is not one job, but a whole range of jobs. Business skills are obviously necessary, whether the position is that of real estate agent or negotiator in transactions. Land developers are also called upon, and they are just as important in this sector. Finally, those who talk about real estate must have in mind the multitude of positions as co-ownership managers. This type of profile is indeed very promising if we consider that more than 10 million homes are directly concerned by this field of competence. Moreover, the real estate professions are also promising for specialized knowledge in the legal field. Legislation is constantly changing, and mastering its workings is essential. In the same vein, accounting skills should not be neglected. And, beyond the skills acquired during training, there is no substitute for the ability to work as part of a team and to meet with various people. Autonomy is an appreciated plus in order to integrate real estate functions.<h2>A wide range of training courses available<\/h2>\nBecoming a real estate professional cannot be improvised. In fact, there are many training programs that allow you to become familiar with a field based on specific skills. Seven types of courses allow you to access the professions in this sector. There is the BTS in real estate professions, the Bachelor's degree in real estate, the professional license, the Master's degree, the DEES, the MBA and the Master's degree in real estate. These specialized programs allow students to acquire knowledge that goes well beyond an exclusively commercial approach.<h2>The attractive commercial real estate sector<\/h2>\nAmong the many areas of the sector, commercial real estate is a sector in its own right. <strong>Commercial real estate<\/strong> professionals like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.locopro-immo-entreprise.com\/\">Locopro<\/a> are dedicated to all the transactions that are constantly growing. Many professionals are indeed looking for offices to buy or rent, and innovative coworking options are also boosting a growing demand. Commercial real estate transactions, whether for premises, walls or business assets, are part of an activity that is still flourishing. Finally, commercial real estate also includes warehouses and <em>business premises<\/em>. Finally, it is often necessary to obtain an unbiased appraisal of the value of a property, which a professional can provide. Diversified and at the heart of the needs faced by populations with particular demands, the real estate sector really opens up great prospects. Attractive and flourishing, because it is essential in any situation, it offers jobs and relies on a constant need for its skills."},"translate-7":{"url":"the-company-events","title":"Focus on the different possible corporate events","h1":"Corporate events","contenu":"[Focus on the different possible corporate events] Many statistics show that employees who benefit from a good team cohesion and a more pleasant atmosphere in the office, can be up to twice as productive.

However, its definition, history and evolution are sometimes unclear. We have therefore conducted research so that the famous overalls no longer hold any secrets for you.<!--more--><h2>Blue overalls: definition<\/h2>\nThe overalls are a <em>protective<\/em> garment adopted in the majority of professional sectors. It is usually worn over clothing to protect against dirt, but depending on its design, it can also address other issues by protecting against friction, pain caused by certain postures or by allowing workers to keep their tools within reach.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-788\" src=\"http:\/\/5s44y58e.cnpas.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/bleu-travail.jpg\" alt=\"bleu travail\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/>\n\nAlthough overalls are mainly used in industries and by professionals who perform manual tasks, the diversity of variants allows them to guarantee adequate protection in a wide range of sectors.<h2>Where does the name \"overalls\" come from?<\/h2>\nThe original blue coat got its name from its color, which is known as Prussian blue or sometimes Berlin blue. The discovery of this color is believed to be accidental, but to date it is impossible to determine its exact origin as theories differ. During a certain period of time,<strong> workers<\/strong> all wore outfits in this specific color, considered the standard color of professional clothing. The name blue of work was thus naturally imposed to indicate these clothes exclusively carried in a professional context. Indeed, Prussian blue was not intended to be worn in everyday life, at least during the first years after its discovery.<h2>Is the blue of work always blue?<\/h2>\nDuring many years, the blue of work was exclusively... blue of Prussia. But over the years, it has kept the name \"blue\", at least in most cases. Indeed, work clothes are most often declined in colors associated with the sector of activity. Blue is still relevant because it is associated with freshness and softness. Its soothing shades are particularly appreciated in the medical sector. Darker blues are more popular in the automotive and construction industries. Blue also exists in red, a color choice that is mainly found on professionals in the food industry. Unsurprisingly, green workwear is especially appreciated by landscapers and all professionals who are in contact with nature (gardens, parks, forests ...). It is a fresh and dynamic color that also finds its place in hospitals, especially on surgeons. Yellow is commonly worn by professionals of beauty and well-being because it is associated with relaxation and naturally pushes to contact. Although it is still called blue workwear, this garment also exists in white, gray, brown, eggplant, black and in all imaginable shades.<strong> Professionals<\/strong> are indeed free to adapt their outfits to the image they wish to project but also to the constraints imposed by their activities. In addition, it is now possible to add touches of personalization to stand out from the crowd with high performance and original outfits.<h2>Work blue historical origin<\/h2>\nAs mentioned earlier, Prussian blue is the result of a laboratory accident whose precise origins remain a mystery. Some sources claim that Heinrich Diesbach and Johann Conrad Dippel created the color. Others say that Johann Jacob Diesbach, who wanted to create a carmine red pigment, was responsible for the discovery. What is certain is that the color was born in Berlin in the 1700s. Prussian blue was the first artificially created pigment. At that time, dark blue was considered the most suitable color for work <strong>clothes<\/strong>. However, its production was expensive because of its complexity. It was therefore not possible to use it to meet a massive need, the profitability being extremely low. In such a context, Diesbach jealously preserved its secrecy in order to keep the monopoly on the marketing of the blue of Prussia. It was not until the 1720's that a man named John Woodward revealed the pigmentation techniques that proved to be particularly economical. This rather unusual blue immediately attracted attention and became the reference <em>color<\/em> for work clothes. It allowed for the mass production of garments adapted to several sectors in order to protect workers engaged in dirty activities. The dark color makes stains less visible. Moreover, it is an extremely easy to maintain blue, which allows professionals to wash their work clothes frequently and effectively remove the various dirt caused by their <strong>jobs<\/strong>.\n\nSince the 18th century, blue has become the universal color of professional clothing and today it is still a timeless color that is readily adopted in any field of activity.

The appearance of machines increasing the risks, it was essential to provide protective clothing to workers. The classic work apron no longer met expectations as the risks were no longer limited to dirt. It was essential to develop clothing that would protect factory teams against stains, splashes, heat, cold... while guaranteeing comfort and functionality during their working hours. The blue overalls naturally emerged as the ideal garment. It was first adopted by industrialists and then worn by professionals in the mechanical and manual sectors. Not only did it protect against various stains but it also increased comfort thanks to the multiple pockets integrated into the design. In addition, the overalls put everyone on the same footing by standardizing the outfits worn in factories and companies. It is at this time that the overalls began to be associated with workers. In order to mark the hierarchical difference, workers of higher categories often wore white (hence the notion of white collar) or wore gray clothes.<h2>The origin and evolution of blue work clothes<\/h2>\nDuring the 19th century, the overalls consisted of a blouse associated with a belt, the objective being to provide maximum protection to workers. However, it turned out that the blouse was not the most practical garment and that the protection offered was limited. As a result, overalls evolved into long-sleeved coveralls or bib and brace overalls. These new versions are easier to put on and offer greater freedom of movement. In addition, it is easier to strategically integrate pockets into overalls and suits. You can find <strong>overalls<\/strong> at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roidutablier.com\/46-combinaison-de-travail\">www.roidutablier.com. The<\/a> evolution of overalls has continued. For obvious reasons of practicality, the bib and brace overalls have gradually given way to a much easier to wear version: the two-piece. This is the most common form of overalls today. From 1968 onwards, blue overalls were adopted on a larger scale. Today, blue overalls no longer refer exclusively to a specific professional outfit, but to workwear in general. In addition to the wide variety of shapes and colors, it is adapted to the requirements of the profession in order to effectively fulfill the functions assigned to it. For example, there are waterproof outfits designed for professionals working in wet environments. On some models, the elbows and knees are reinforced to ensure better resistance to wear. Other versions have a certain resistance to fire and heat. While overalls still have the same purpose of protecting workers, they have been given new designs and features to meet the highest standards. It has evolved enormously in terms of aesthetics and new techniques give it greater resistance, which is accompanied by optimized comfort."},"translate-9":{"url":"rideaux-design-bureau","title":"Why choose design curtains for your office?","h1":"Choose design curtains for your office","contenu":"The office is the workspace where you spend most of your time and your day, whether you are in a coworking space, an open-space or at home in telecommuting!
