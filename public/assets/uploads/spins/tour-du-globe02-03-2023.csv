Mon top 5 en Turquie *Video *mon-top-5-en-turquie*<p style="text-align: justify;"> My search for culture and exoticism led me to <b> Turkey</b>. It was a great choice as I wasn't disappointed with all there was to see. It is an undiscovered gem worth the journey, but it's not just the cuisine that makes the experience worthwhile. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> My <b><i>Turkey</i></b> trip was a great success, so I am sharing <b><i>the top 5 Turkey</i></b> experiences! It is stunning and gives you an idea of the sights you can see. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> <b> <b>Top 3 starting strong</b> </b> </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> This top is based on my <b><i>trip to Istanbul</i></b>, during which I saw many things. It's an important city so I spent a lot of time exploring the <b> city</b>. There are many historical districts, banks along the Bosphorus and evenings at Taksim. The Turkish capital has everything you need to make your stay enjoyable . </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> The <b><i>route to Anatolia</i></b> was then taken. It didn't disappoint me. It is easy to get to the center. It is easily accessible from Istanbul and allows you to reach one of Turkey's most popular regions. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> This is where I <b><i>found Cappadocia</i></b>. There I was able to see the sovereign cities Kaymakl, and Derinkuyu. Consider visiting Derinkuyu and Kaymakl underground cities if you are planning to visit the area. You won't find many places like it. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> <b> <b>Enjoy a few days at Bodrum</b> </b> </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Fiesta fans will always remember Bodrum <i><b>as their</b></i> visit. There is so much to recall! I found time between the beach parties and all the fun, but I also managed to go to <b><i>visit</i></b> <b><i>Bodrum</i></b> and see the many archaeological sites that were there. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> It must have remembered the shape of my feet after I spent so many hours on <b><i>Bodrum</i></b>. It's well worth the effort, as you can stretch out like a starfish and not be bothered. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Last place that I wanted to <b><i>explore in Turkey</i></b> was the Pamukkale Park, an Unesco-protected natural area. We quickly discovered many new things during our visit. It is quiet and beautiful. </p>
Mexico: Immediate Boarding *Video *boarding-immediat-to-mexico*<p style="text-align: justify;"> It is worth visiting Mexico <i><b>while on a</b></i> vacation. You can enjoy 2 tequilas. It's not easy to tell the difference due to the wealth of Mexico. Although I would have loved to visit everything, time constraints meant that I could only choose the best. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> I found it a good thing as it enabled me to see beautiful places. You can find out more information about the places you should see to plan your <b> vacation</b> to Mexico. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> <b> <b>Guanajuato in the same state</b> </b> </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> It is vibrant, alive and full of everything that we love. Guanajuato, Mexico is worth a visit. This is one of the largest cities that has a mixed population. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> It's worth mentioning that I found a true cultural soup when I entered Guanajuato's heart. It's a must-see for anyone who wants to know more about Mexico's <b> History</b> or to just spend some time without it. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> <b> <b>Palenque is a stunning archaeological site</b> </b> </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> It will be a great experience for <b><i>Aztec</i></b>, Mayan <b><i>Culture</i></b> fans. You can admire remnants of an ancient city by visiting Palenque. It is better to enjoy sport than to be sedentary with all those stairs! </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> For a jungle tour, you will need strong legs. We are transported back to the days when the jungle was a lush, green place. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> <b> <b>State of Oxaca</b> </b> </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> To dive in Mexico , first visit the identical city. Oxaca, a quiet and peaceful place that can recharge you after a long day in noisy places is perfect. It is peaceful and quiet, so it will not be difficult to reach the <b><i>Monte Alban</i></b>. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> We ate local food and Mexican chocolate before heading to Monte Alban, to check out the Olmecs' activities. It was so similar to what I had seen on Palenque <i><b>'s</b></i> websites, even though the decor is completely unrelated. </p>
Antwerp: Elegance and beauty in flatland *Video *anvers-elegance-au-plat-pays*<p style="text-align: justify;"> Have you been searching travel websites for several weeks in search of THE <em>location for your next vacation</em> ? Are you familiar with Antwerp Yes, you are correct. I will tell you it is well worth the effort. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Actually, my parents took me there and I didn't really like it at first. But I was very surprised when I got to see the beauty of Antwerp. This is an opportunity to share <strong><em>about the beauty and elegance of Antwerp.</em></strong> </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> <strong> <strong>Steen Castle: An incredible discovery</strong> </strong> </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Two things: History and I, history has always been two. But <strong><em>Steen Castle</em></strong> should be your first choice when visiting Antwerp. It is worth the trip, I promise. This was a great trip, and I loved seeing many Eiffel designs. You may have made the connection between the Eiffel Tower, and it's true! It's a tiny world, indeed! </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You will also find many interesting monuments if you visit the <strong> Steen Castle</strong>. Antwerp is beautiful, what would you think? I'm not! </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> <strong> <strong>Unusual architecture at the Amberes Palace for Justice</strong> </strong> </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Following the <strong><em>Steen Castle</em></strong> I went to the famous <strong><em>Amberes Palace of Justice</em></strong>. Everyone was talking about it so it seemed like a nice idea to visit it. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> The building is actually called many things, which I have not noticed until now. You can decide for yourself once you have been there. It's described as a butterfly by some, while others describe it more like a myth. It's your call to decide! </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> <strong> <strong>History of the Statue of Silvio Brabo</strong> </strong> </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Although I didn't understand the history of Barbo I believe that guides and historians will be able to give more detailed explanations. The only thing I could recall was that Silvio Barbo had ripped off the hand of a giant in order to get tolls for poor captains. Can you see what I mean? This feat earned him the statue. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Anyway, I'm going to learn more about the <strong><em>"living legend" of Antwerp</em></strong>. It is by far one of my most bizarre experiences. </p>
Rouen: 5 Things You Must See *Video *the-5-things-not-to-miss-in-rouen*<p style="text-align: justify;"> Rouen! It's a charming place, I promise! You might consider going to the city for a weekend with your loved one or for family vacation. You will not be disappointed! Rouen is happy to make your summer as enjoyable and relaxing as winter. Although it's not a traditional French dish, I don't recommend you make a meal of Rouen. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> There are actually at least <strong><em>five places that caught my eye in Rouen</em></strong>. You will find plenty of places to visit. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> <strong> <strong>Film screenings for artists</strong> </strong> </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong><em>A visit to Rouen</em></strong> will allow you to experience a town with an extraordinary charm. There are many things to do in Rouen: projections and shows. The stay will please art lovers. The "Monet aux Pixels" far projection is one example of a show you shouldn't miss. It's unique, that is all I can say. It will be a great experience, I promise! </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> <strong> <strong>A museum for education and students</strong> </strong> </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> It is likely <strong><em>to be the largest museum in France</em></strong>. It was huge! I nearly lost my way. Later, I discovered that there were nearly 950,000 works and objects in the museum. It's amazing! They are amazing and even more incredible when you discover them yourself! It's so amazing that you will wish you could have more heads. This was my impression when I visited France. France is our home! </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> <strong> <strong>Rouen et Pierre Corneille</strong> </strong> </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong><em>Pierre Corneille</em></strong> looks a lot like Justin Bieber in Rouen. This city is a nod to this famous poet. Although Corneille did not live in Rouen his entire life, he was still very frequent there. Like Justin Bieber's relationship with Canada </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> The city is able to take a lot credit for his achievements. Corneille is the one I am referring to. We take it and Justin will be absent for some time so that we can moralize with Pierre Corneille. You will also find the <strong><em>Big Watch</em></strong> as well the <strong><em>Museum of Ceramics</em></strong>, which is more than worth it. </p>
Colmar, the Alsatian treasure *Video *colmar-le-tresor-alsacien*<p style="text-align: justify;"> Telling you Alsace will make your first reaction to me think about the ocean, swimming, and seafood. We can't wait to go on summer vacation. To make sure you are even more excited to go, here is a <strong><em>guide tour through Colmar</em></strong>. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> If you are not familiar with the <strong><em>Alsatian treasure Colmar</em></strong> I can give you an overview. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> <strong> <strong>Colmar, a picturesque city</strong> </strong> </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Colmar is very well-known in Alsace. To avoid becoming lost if you're planning on going there in the near future, please read these instructions. For example, the " <strong><em>Little Venice</em></strong>" is a lively, bustling place. This is why it's called Little Venice. Because a tiny part of the city has water. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Just like the <strong><em>Venice</em></strong>. This is exactly what makes the island so appealing to tourists. You will need a boat to reach it or visit it. Romantic, isn't it? This could make a great place to propose (wink at Jules). </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> <strong> <strong>In the middle of the city</strong> is the Kopfhus </strong> </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> It is easy to spot because of its unique architecture. It is located in central Colmar and it's impossible to miss. The building has been designated a historical monument. It even offers a restaurant. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> The menu can be a little expensive but it is worth the price. This is a great place to go on a date, or celebrate an important event (second wink at Jules). </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> <strong> <strong>We don't forget about the Place Rapp</strong> </strong> </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> The <strong><em>Statue of the General Rapp</em></strong> is located nearby. This place Rapp, which gets its name from him is always animated in both summer and winter. Colmar was closed to me in the summer, so I couldn't see all of its fountains. However, I was informed that there is an ice rink in winter. This is a practical option for families vacations. </p>
Thailand: Jewels of the Kingdom *Video *thailand-kingdom-joys*<p style="text-align: justify;"> While many people wish to travel abroad, very few actually do so. Thailand was one of my favorite places, and it took me quite a while to make a decision. Although it can seem scary initially, the journey is worth it. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> For an example, Thailand is home to jewels which are nothing to be jealous of in the rest. It is enough to turn any tourist's mind. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> <strong> <strong>Koh Lanta's crazy charm</strong> </strong> </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Let me first say that Koh Lanta does not look like you imagine! Although it is an island, everything you need is right there. There are hotels, beaches, and relaxation. This place is perfect for <strong> family</strong> and friends. It gives you the feeling that everything is perfect. I promise you that the walks along the beach, the hammock naps, and the massages will be unforgettable when you return home. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> <strong> <strong>Bangkok's floating market</strong> </strong> </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Everything that appeals to the tourist market can be found in Bangkok. A remarkable number of tourists also visited Bangkok during my time there. For example, the <strong><em>market in DamnoenSaduak</em></strong> is known as "The floating Market of Bangkok". </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You will need to go on a boat to shop here. It's not the best place for people who fear drowning, but it is worth it. You will need to take a bus to get to the market. Remember that agencies won't hesitate to give you <strong> very expensive prices</strong>. It is a minor drawback to this trip. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> <strong> <strong>Sunset stroll on TonSai</strong> </strong> </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> There are many beaches in Thailand. But the Tonsai beach is my favourite. It is a remote area with few people. You must travel by boat to reach it. It is a feeling that you will feel lost and disorientated. It is <strong><em>far from big cities</em></strong>. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> It is also without electricity so candles are lit in the evening to create a romantic ambience. Don't be alarmed, it isn't like the show "Lost", except that no one fights for survival. </p>
Loire Valley Castles: What are you waiting for? *Video *chateaux-de-la-loire-by-or-commence*<p style="text-align: justify;"> Do you ever dream of the castle life? We live in an age that makes this impossible. But, it is possible to visit castles! </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> For example, you can go to the <strong><em>Loire Valley Castles</em></strong> and see what life might have looked like if you were born in a different era. Here's a list of buildings you should not miss when passing by the Loire. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> <strong> <strong>Let us start at Chenonceau</strong> </strong> </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> It is the <strong><em>castle at Chenonceau</em></strong>, which is the largest castle in the Loire. It is also more accessible and does not damage anything. It costs 8 Euros to enter the garden, but they aren't free. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Chenonceau was always a <strong><em>royalty property</em></strong>, and this guided tour will allow you to see the vast domain from multiple perspectives. It will be a great experience. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> <strong> <strong>Now let's go to the Chateau de d'Azay Le Rideau</strong> </strong> </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> The elegance and beauty of this castle was what I felt more connected to when I first visited it. Amazing how Renaissance architects created it. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> This <strong> Loire castle</strong> is unique and will make you ecstatic. It is also the most well-known in Tour. There is much to learn! </p> <p style="text-align: center;"> </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> <strong> <strong>The jump to Castle of Angers</strong> is the final step. </strong> </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> The Maine's last castle is unquestionably the most prominent. It is impossible to miss this castle. Its uniqueness derives from the massive ramparts that were once a defense fortress. The <strong><em>castle in Angers</em></strong> has a rich history that is well worth a visit. I was pleasantly surprised by the imperfections. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You can also call it the <strong><em>"castle o' King Rene</em></strong>", but also the "castle o' the Dukes of Anjou". It is another jewel you will regret not living during the Middle Ages. Well, almost... </p>
My white hair is gone! *How to get rid of your white hair *se-debarasser-des-cheveux-blancs*<p style="text-align: justify;"> The natural process of getting whiter hair occurs as a result of ageing. There are many options to conceal their presence if they happen. To make them go away, you can choose a gray hair <strong>color</strong>. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> How do you get white hair? </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> The color <strong>of hair</strong> comes from pigments found in the body called melanin. The hair becomes white when melanocytes (the cells which secrete them) stop producing them. The hair transition process is completely natural. Even if your hair has turned white, it can still be healthy. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Many people see their first gray hairs around 40. Hair loss can also be caused by other factors. <strong>White hair</strong> can be explained by heredity. Some people believe stress and extreme weather can cause gray hair to appear, even though there's no evidence. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> What is the point of using a hair color product to dye your hair white? </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Some people feel proud of their grey hair. However, hair color can be used to change that. It's both trendy and practical. You can choose a simple or complex balayage depending on how much white hair you have. A permanent <strong>colour</strong> can be used to completely dye hair. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Be sure to select a color that complements your skin's <strong>complexion and</strong> form before you apply it. You have many options to color your hair white. You can also have a wild look with your <strong>new hairstyle</strong>. To choose the right shade of hair color, you can look to current trends in hair dyeing. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Visit a <strong>hair clinic</strong> for a hair analysis <a href="https://www.cliniqueducheveu.fr/analyse-diagnostic-cheveux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.cliniqueducheveu.fr/analyse-diagnostic-cheveux/ And</a>since we're talking about a girlie subject, check out my latest article on jewelry. </p>
Auckland, also known as the City of Sails, is a favorite. *Video *auckland-or-the-city-of-sails-a-coup-de-coeur-assure*<p style="text-align: justify;"> Are you planning a trip to New Zealand in the future? Auckland is the country's most populous area. It was the "city of sails" as I called it, and I enjoyed it immensely. It has everything, no matter if it's a large city or nature, but you also have a beautiful beach that you can spend hours relaxing on. These are my top picks in the city. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> Auckland, the great city </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Auckland, New Zealand's capital city is also the largest. The <strong>Sky Tower</strong> is the landmark of Auckland. It's undoubtedly the tallest tower in New Zealand, and it's also larger than the Eiffel Tower. You'll see why it was my first crush once you get up there. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> If you are passionate about this type of area, then you can walk the <strong>Auckland Museum</strong>. Not only will you learn beautiful facts about wars that New Zealand participated in, but there are also many cultural surprises. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>It is the Marina</strong> that gave birth to its name, "The City of Sails". The Auckland Marina has more than 135,000 boats. If you love boats you will enjoy an amazing show. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> Nature and the sea </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Auckland is more than just the city. It is about nature and beautiful beaches. It's impossible to see all the beaches, so I suggest the <strong>Bay Islands</strong> three-day trip to Auckland. You can also visit the Waiheke and Rangitoto islands, which are stunning. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> These islands are a great place to go for a day trip to view dolphins and whales. This is an unforgettable experience and one I highly recommend. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You don't have to worry about me, those who love to lounge around are still my priority. <strong>Oneroa Bay</strong> is on Waiheke island, and it's a lovely place to spend the day in the sun. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>Takapuna Beach</strong>, which is right in front the Harbour Bridge, has white sandy beaches, and calm waters, makes it a great choice. Piha Beach is a great spot for both surfers and everyone. This beach is of unsurpassed beauty. </p>
Principles of phytotherapy *Video *the-principles-of-phytotherapy*<p style="text-align: justify;"> Alternative medicine, herbal medicine, is growing in popularity. It is one of many alternative medicine options that relies on medicinal plants we have available in our world. Many of us are aware that traditional medicine is not the only option. There are many natural ways to heal us. Today I want to speak a bit about phytotherapy. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> The principles of phytotherapy </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>Phytotherapy</strong> refers to a medical treatment that relies on the healing powers of plants in order to manage various conditions that may affect our everyday lives. We now have the benefit of years and years worth of research. Even more remarkable is the fact that homeopathy is being recommended by more doctors to help patients. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> This medicine works on a simple principle. All of the proposed treatments and medicines are based upon plants and their effects. It is not possible to use the entire plant because its active ingredients are concentrated in one component: the flowers, leaves and buds as well as the roots. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Self-medication with <strong>herbal medicines</strong> is dangerous. While the side effects are not serious, there is always the possibility of them if they are not administered properly. A personalized consultation and an assessment are required. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> Which diseases are it good for? </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>Herbal medicine</strong> is not just for treating illnesses. I want to be clear about this. Although it is true that there are many remedies available at pharmacies now for minor ailments, this does not mean they stop there. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> The best thing about phytotherapy is the variety of products we have available to help us stay fit and to improve our health. <strong>Phytotherapy</strong> can also help with anxiety and other psychological issues. If you are looking to lose weight, it can be used in conjunction with your diet. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> Take care not to mix substances. </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You should be aware that <strong>herbal treatments</strong> may have side effects. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Certain products can cancel or worsen the effects of contraceptives, while others may cause heart and circulatory problems. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> If you are currently undergoing treatment, I recommend that you see your doctor. </p>

The essentials of my stay in Vietnam *Video *my-stay-in-vietnam-must-see*<p style="text-align: justify;"> It doesn't matter if you know the places well in advance, but it is much easier to get a general idea about what must-see spots are. Let me now show you the must-see places in Vietnam that are not missed during your Vietnam trip. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You have many options for organizing your holiday in Vietnam, regardless of whether you use travel guides or any other resources. It is essential to be familiar with the must-sees of Vietnam to ensure a memorable stay. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> <strong> <strong>Hoi An</strong> </strong> </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> After arriving in Vietnam, I decided that I would stop in Ho Chi Minh City for two nights to get some rest before heading to Hoi An. Because I wanted to visit the city of lanterns, I didn't really want to spend any time in Saigon. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> My choice was right. The small town of <strong>Hoi An</strong>, home to 120,000 people, has everything I need. This city is located 30 km from Da Nang and was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its diverse housing. There are buildings in Japanese, Chinese, and French styles. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> It is easy to see the many assets that have been inherited by this port city. The Japanese pagoda bridge, which spans the river, that used to connect the Japanese and Chinese neighborhoods is what I loved the most. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Visitors to Hoi An will also be delighted by the boats and lanterns. They are found all over the city, and they give off a unique and warm atmosphere when it gets dark. It will be like going back to when sailors and silk traders used to stroll the streets. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You can also add the sailing skiffs and sampans that will take you to your destination. You'll immediately feel the exotic appeal of Vietnam. Some people might say this is a tourist destination. It is, however, one of the best museums anywhere. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> <strong> <strong>Hue</strong> </strong> </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong></strong> I might tell you right from the start that this is the old <strong>imperial capitol of Vietnam</strong>. It is a common occurrence that you'll hear this and know that you should visit Vietnam during your Vietnam trip. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> The Imperial City and the Royal City won me over. The area is surrounded by ramparts of large size that cover 2.5km. This is quite amazing! Some walls reach as high as 20 meters. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You will also find the Imperial Yellow City, and Forbidden Purple City once you get inside. Even though many of the imperial and royal buildings have been destroyed, this citadel's charm and the other buildings are still intact. It was a wonderful place to imagine in its glory days. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Tourists who don't appreciate the beauty and history of ancient stones can consider Hue a collection of stone piles under reconstruction. It was an enjoyable experience for me to visit this cultural mecca. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> <strong> <strong>Ninh Binh</strong> </strong> </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong></strong>I visited Hue and decided to visit <strong>, the land-based Ha Long Bay</strong>. As you know, my curiosity can lead me to impossible experiences. It was a great decision that I didn't regret. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You will find impressive karst mountains on the route to Ninh Binh. The boat can cruise along these natural channels and artifices, which sometimes go through caves in the rocks. This is a stunning place that can be used to make beautiful pictures of your travels. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> The legs of women propel the boats. Only ladies are allowed to paddle. They can do this with either their hands or feet, and occasionally even a stick if they are tired. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You can take a boat trip to see the temples along the canals. This will add an interesting atmosphere to the journey. This trip would get the highest score if I could. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> <strong> <strong>Hanoi</strong> </strong> </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong></strong> I didn't visit Ho Chi Minh City, however, I visited Hanoi, Vietnam's <strong>capital</strong>. We get two opinions from travelers when we ask them about Hanoi. It is something I support and it should be included in my list of must-see destinations in Vietnam. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> It is also the capital of Vietnam. This is where one can learn about the entire history of north Vietnam. It was built in 1010 and became the capital for French Indochina between 1954 and 1976. This city has a diverse and rich heritage. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Streets in this old city were used once to trade or sell different commodities. Some streets, such as streets for textile, ironwork, or shoes, are still in existence. There were 36 guide who had their own street. Even though the traditions have been greatly altered by modern economics, some elements of this atmosphere still need to be found. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> It also features a bazaar and Asian souk that I found fascinating. There are many shops that can help you. You can find everything from the bike-riding flower seller to the streetside improvised eateries. Walking in the city requires that you have both eyes and ears. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> The <strong>cuisine</strong> is another advantage to this area. There are many dishes to suit all tastes, thanks to the mix of French, Vietnamese, and Chinese cultures. It's a pleasure to enjoy a refreshing glass of fruit juice while enjoying a delicious Pho. This city is a treasure trove of diversity and animation. </p> Also, check out my must-sees <a href="https://oyvcs0oj.tour-du-globe.com/voyage-en-Inde-du-Sud/"> South India trip </a> !

A 4x4 Safari is a great way to see beautiful scenery, as well as the rich biodiversity of the natural reserve. You will see a change in scenery. <h2> </h2> <h2> Select the best period </h2> You might be tempted by the prospect of going on a safari to Africa. But, you should plan your stay ahead of time to avoid being disappointed. Otherwise, it is possible to end up in the middle or the worst part of the rainy season and not have the opportunity to explore the area. The best season to go on safari in Tanzania is April through November. It's also the most popular time of year to visit the country, especially during dry seasons, which are May through October.

You can do it by 4x4, foot, or boat. Although all of the scenery is beautiful and unique, not all national parks are created equal. Be sure to ask about the best places to photograph safaris. For example, the Serengeti and Tarangire national parks would be ideal for 4x4 tours. These reserves allow you to traverse the most beautiful regions.
