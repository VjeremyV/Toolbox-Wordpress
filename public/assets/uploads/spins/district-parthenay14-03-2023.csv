My dream destinations... My dream destination...Lombardy! *Video *my-destinations-in-lombardy*What about taking a vacation to Italy? <b> <i> <i>Discover Lombardy</i> </i> </b> ? It is my third time to this city and it remains one of my favourite Italian cities. If you are interested in a Lombardy trip, here's some information. The places I have seen are worth the effort since I was there. There are many places on my list that you can relax and take in the sights while enjoying your vacation. Here are some tips about places that I loved visiting. <p style="text-align: center;"> </p> <h2> <b> <b>Locations in the City Center</b> </b> </h2> <b> <i> <i>Downtown Lombardy</i> </i> </b> There are many sites in Italy that you want to see more than one time. To make sure you have a good experience, I recommend Piazza del Duomo in the middle of Milan. It's a great place to go, and you will have ample time to tell yourself that you have arrived at Piazza del Duomo. It has an arch that draws a lot of tourists. This arch vaguely reminds of the national arch. It's often crowded so I don't recommend going there during weekends. Galleria Vittorio Emileele is another place worth visiting in the center of Rome. It is without doubt one the most important shopping centers in the region. It's not a tourist attraction per se. It is still a tourist attraction. It is even possible that many locals wander around feeling overwhelmed by the number of foreigners. It was an opportunity for me to find great French brands. Attention to all the shoppers who are sure to find happiness in France. The place can also be used to shop for gifts. Avoid if you're a compulsive purchaser with limited budget. Your heart is more vulnerable than any other thing. Finally, <b> <i> <i>The center of Lombardy</i> </i> </b> The castle of Sforza is also worth a visit. This is a site you will enjoy with your entire family or on your own for even more explorations. <p style="text-align: center;"> </p> <h2> <b> <b>Visit Varenne</b> </b> </h2> Varenne, I believe is one of my favorite. <b> <i> <i>Places in Lombardy</i> </i> </b> Its simplicity and ease are what make it so appealing. This town is simple and comfortable, yet it's worth the effort for anyone who loves beautiful views. The village of Varenne offers a stunning panoramic view and one of the most beautiful old Rome architectures. This village that looks almost like paradise was once destroyed in medieval times. Varenne, undoubtedly, is one of Italy's most beautiful places where churches still exude their original beauty. It is a place with a strong smell of authenticity that made me want to return to France. I discovered, however, that the place was full of stories. It was enough to entertain children and spend some peaceful evenings. You might be surprised at the friendly welcome you receive from the Varenne residents if you happen to pass through Varenne. This is another great point about the area! <h2> <b> <b>End with Lake Iseo</b> </b> </h2> You may need to find some peace and quiet during your busy day. <b> <i> <i>Stay in Lombardy</i> </i> </b> I believe a visit to Lake Iseo is a good idea. There are many things you can do to relax at Lake Iseo. You can relax in this area with the lush greenery and the tranquility of the lake. It's not allowed to even dip one foot into this lake. Tourists can still enjoy the tranquility and fresh air in the surrounding area. The program includes a picnic. When you're spending a couple of hours at a stunning place such as Lake Iseo, which I love in Lombardy, the simplest approach is often the best.

The situation has changed somewhat over the past few years. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Tourism is gradually picking up, even though it is still shy. The country is trying hard to rebuild and find some sense of normalcy. It would help you to learn more about Iran if you are considering making it your next destination.

Would you like to learn more? </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> Iran, in just a few words </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Iran, once known as Persia, is a Middle East country. Tehran is the capital of Iran. The official name of Iran is <strong>, the Islamic Republic of Iran</strong>. According to 2015 surveys, the country has an area of 1,648,000 km2 and 81,224 870 people. According to surveys in 2015, the country covers an area of approximately 1,648,000 square kilometers. There are 81,224.870 inhabitants. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Although Persian is the official language, many people still speak regional languages. <strong>Iran's population is made up of many different ethnicities</strong> and have lived together for quite some time. They include Persians as well as Kurds (Assyrians), Kurds, Kurds, Kurds, Kurds, Armenians, and others. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> The government tried for the past few years to improve the economy of the country, but has not succeeded. Although they are trying to make the country more open to the outside world, the past has had a difficult time. <strong>The country</strong> was <strong>enslaved by its economic blockade</strong> since decades. The country's agriculture and livestock aren't well-developed, particularly with the increasing population. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> Art and culture </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> It's a confession that I took a trip last year to visit this country. I returned in one piece but with the <strong>unique feeling of meeting a country</strong> and their people, and learning about its secrets. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> For me, architecture is the best form of art in this country. <strong>I will never cease to be amazed by the beauty of these magnificent mosques</strong>. The domes are adorned with multicolored ceramics, which makes them a pure structure. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>Poetry is the dominant form of literature</strong>. It was a surprise to me that Iranians devoted so much attention to Persian classical poets, who are ardent supporters of Persian culture. But, this must be acknowledged. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Calligraphy and painting form part of Persian culture. The carpet is the best representation of Iran's handicrafts. They are very soft, and can have unique patterns according to the city. It is handmade, so be careful! </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>is the city's traditional music</strong>. Music is usually forbidden in cities. The Internet, however, allows for modern music to be transmitted, particularly among the young. The cinema isn't appreciated much in this country. The fact that Westerners know more about the movies of their home countries than its inhabitants is a sign of how modern the culture and religion of Westerners. </p> <p style="text-align: center;"> </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> Where to Eat in Iran </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Iran's food is excellent, in fact, very good. <strong>We must say that the local cuisine is delicious</strong>. This is not something you'll find in restaurants. There are no fast-food restaurants in this area. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You will need to be invited to a family to enjoy the delicious food from Iran . This should be easy, as the Iranian people are extremely welcoming, despite all the laws. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> They always receive guests according to the rules of art when welcoming people. To help you find the local flavors and smells, they will offer you many dishes from their region. <strong>These dishes are unique</strong>, I have to admit. Before they leave, they like to ensure that all their guests are satisfied. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> There are certain points you should be aware of </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You must follow many rules when you first arrive at your destination. Sometimes, it even begins 10 minutes before you reach the airport. <strong>Clothing issues at home are extremely important</strong>. These rules must be respected. This applies to tourists and non-tourists alike. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Covering your arms and legs must be a male habit. This means no more Hawaiian shirts or shorts. You have <strong>for women to cover your</strong> neck, hair, legs, and cleavage <strong>as</strong> possible. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You should not expose your curves . During your trip, you will need to use the veil and long loose tunics. You are permitted to use colors and make-up, however. You don't have to dress as though you are in mourning. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> It is against the law to display affection between women and men , or have any physical contact with someone who isn't a member of your family.

A place that has too much decoration makes it uncomfortable to be in. It's happened many times to me, so you can see that this is always my living room. This is why I made this article. It will give you tips and great ideas for decorating your living space as it should. It isn't something you do randomly. Otherwise, there wouldn't be professionals making millions by improving the living rooms of others. What are some ways to decorate your living space? </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> It is important to know what it will look like. </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> First <strong>consider what your living space will look like</strong> before you start thinking about how to decorate it. You can't deny that this is the room where most of us spend our time, aside from the bedroom. What is the purpose of it? Everybody has different preferences, so it can be difficult for busy individuals to design a living space that suits their needs. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You probably enjoy watching TV or using the console to entertain people, and you have several things that you'd like to do. I suggest you <strong>start a list</strong>. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Make some decisions depending on how much space you have for your living room. You won't always be able to fit everything in there. Most furniture won't fit in your living room. You have to limit your possibilities. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> Arrange the furniture according to your activities </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> After you've decided on the activities that you would like to engage in, you can <strong>organize your living space</strong> and arrange the furniture. It doesn't need to look like that. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You can use a piece of paper to draw the corners that will be placed in your living room. Arrange each activity according to its importance . You should first place the areas with the greatest constraints. For example, the TV corner, which can take up space and require the installation of electrical and lighting sources, is one such area. You must also consider the fact that windows are a barrier to organizing the various activity areas. You should place areas which are easy to categorize, like the entertainment area. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> How to choose the best furniture for your living space </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> After you've decided where you want it to go, the next step is <strong>choosing the furniture</strong>. There are many furniture options available today. Sometimes it can be difficult to choose the right furniture model. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> In order to choose the right furniture you should consider your personal taste and your specific needs . But, most importantly, think about your style preferences . You can't live without certain furniture in your living room, such as the couch or the coffee table. Then, choose furniture that you are most interested in. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You must not <strong>over-furnish the living area</strong>. This will make it feel cramped. It is best to only take what you require to furnish the living room and make it functional. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> I recommend thinking about small spaces. For example, the TV table with bookcase and a corner table that doubles as a desk can be used. A successful decor is more than a space filled with furniture. It should also be a harmonious combination of the styles and colors that you choose. </p> <p style="text-align: center;"> </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> You might also consider a nomadic style for your living space. </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> The best option for me is <strong>my nomadic living space</strong>. I'm a true traveler. A nomadic lounge can be described as a space that is open to all who wish to travel. It transports people to the tropics or the jungle, and allows them to feel at home. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> It is important to consider several factors when decorating this style. You are not going to decorate a standard living room. Instead, you will add a bit of culture . </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> If you wish to think about Asia, you could choose to have a chair on the ground. You can place <strong>an armchair of ethnic origin in the corner</strong> and add decorative items from all four corners of the world to your living space. It's like a complete change of scene without ever leaving the house. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> As far as colors go, I recommend <strong>choosing bright colors</strong> but you can also use warm tones such as yellow, ochre, or saffron. You will be able to see the effect it has on your wall once you have applied it. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> When choosing furniture for your home, it is important to choose the ethnic design. However, custom furniture and wicker furniture are also options. A corner African chair will add a lot of character to the space, as well as exotic wooden tables and a Chinese buffet. Choose your furniture carefully in order for it to be harmonious. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> A second tip is that it's not a good idea to restrict yourself to only one culture or country. The <strong>combination of styles</strong> can produce stunning results. </p>
Get started skiing with me! *Video *learn-ski-with-me-today*<p style="text-align: justify;"> The temperature is dropping and I am happy. The snow is coming soon so I can go on vacation to enjoy winter sports. Since I started skiing a while back, I can tell you how much I enjoy the gentle snow and the wind whipping around my face. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Although I don't consider myself a sado, I have to admit that I find this feeling quite uplifting. Are you ready to take up skiing for the new season? Yes, you are right. I was looking to teach some lessons without having to be a professional. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> These are the basics of skiing. </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You must learn basic principles of skiing if you wish to safely . You should be aware that not all slopes will look the same. There are many levels of difficulty, which can be indicated by signs. A green sign indicates an easy slope. Blue is for intermediate slopes. Red, on the other hand, signifies a challenging slope. Black, which only exists for extremely skilled skiers, has a red sign. You should choose the best slope for your experience level and knowledge. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> These signs may be confusing at times, however. The difficulty level of a slope may vary from ski resort to resort. A green slope might be difficult in one place while a blue slope could be in another. To be safe, and start off well, I recommend that you <strong>always start with an easy run</strong>. If you feel it's too easy, you can always switch to a harder slope. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>is a priority rule</strong>. It's those downstream of you and those further down the trail who have it. Avoid them as much possible. You should also maintain a distance from others, especially if your skis are still difficult to control. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> To avoid any accidents, you must learn how to control your descent . If you feel tired or irritable, it is a good idea to take a break and get a cup of hot chocolate. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> How to wear your skis </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You should rent your equipment, and not buy it. I recommend that you <strong>speak with the staff at the shop to help you</strong> choose your skis. You will struggle to put them on if they are not the correct size. Ask them to adjust the tightening. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Your feet shouldn't feel squashed in your ski boots when you are resting. When you bend your knees, your toes should not touch the boots. <strong>To prevent injury, the boot must provide support to your ankle</strong>. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>How do you walk in ski boots</strong> It's best to slow down and walk slowly. However, it is also advisable to roll your feet from heel to tip while moving your body along. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Once you have your boots on, take your skis and poles with you to the trail. I suggest that you <strong>wear gloves</strong> before going on the trail. The skis are sharp and can be sharpened. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Are you finally done with those annoying skis? It's now time to take those pesky skis off . But how do you do it? Simply press down on the lever to align the boot with the ski. Push the tip of your pole into the notch on the lever. </p> <p style="text-align: center;"> </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> These are some basics about skiing you should know </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> If you're new to ski instruction, I believe you should sign up. It is always safer to have an expert with you in order to assist you. Learning is safer when you have a competent person around. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>While it may seem small to learn how to ski</strong>, I assure you it is not. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> To <strong>move with skis</strong> you must keep them parallel. Next, push your poles forward by placing them at the same time and pushing your arms forward. When you have to walk, I recommend you do the same. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You should also take time to determine which method is right for you. To avoid overloading your upper body, I recommend <strong>using the duck walk</strong> and the skatewalk as a beginner. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>is the most basic position</strong> that you can adopt when you hit the pistes. To avoid sliding forwards, I recommend spreading the tips of your skis as a duck. Spread your back tips to avoid sliding forward. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You will also need to stop when you're on the trail . For this purpose, you can point your tips towards one another by pointing the skis in the opposite direction. Push your heels forward to create an open triangle in the back, with the front facing downward. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> To practice, choose a track that is at your level </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>Choose the best track</strong> to practice safe and comfortable since you're a beginner. To practice safely, I recommend that you choose the slopes for children. There is nothing to shame about, it's okay to begin somewhere. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>Take an easier track</strong>, if you're more experienced and have more knowledge. You'll have more options and confidence if you are more knowledgeable. </p>
Norway's splendor is yours *Video *discover-norway-in-all-its-splendor*<p style="text-align: justify;"> You probably know that I'm a curious person. I love to discover new things and have fun. When it comes to travel destinations, Norway was something I knew a lot about, particularly in relation to its richness and beauty. It was then that I bought a Norwegian ticket. It's not something I regret, but I will say that I am glad I made the decision to go on this trip. The trip was well worth the effort! Today, I am going to write about the experience, and to encourage you to visit. But, I also want to share this incredible discovery with you! </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> Oslo is the start of your Norway trip </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Your <strong>first step in Norway</strong> is a passage through Oslo, one of the most picturesque cities in this country. Oslo is a fascinating city, I have to admit. It is clean and not as crowded as other cities I have visited. It is clear from the moment you get there that there are no pollutants and that it is clean. It is very relaxing. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> There are many parks and green areas in the city that are open to all. It is enjoyed by both tourists and Norwegians alike. <strong>The Vigeland Park</strong> is one example. It is actually the park that surprised me most of all the others I visited. There are more than 200 statues throughout the park. You can admire them at your own pace. The park is also home to beautiful flowers. It is a must-see destination for tourists. However, it is definitely worth the effort. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Oslo is also an expression of Norway's culture, history and art. You should take the ferry from Oslo to <strong>on the Bygdoy</strong> peninsula. There are amazing discoveries you can make at the Viking Ship Museum and Norwegian Folk Art Museum once you get there. You will have plenty of entertainment while you're there, I am sure. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> Here are some of my favorites that I'd like to share </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> There were some things I loved about Norway. You can see that I was astonished by the <strong>Northern Lights</strong>. It is without wanting to be too sentimental, but I have to admit it is the most stunning phenomenon I see in the world. It is a beautiful sight that should be seen even if it is cold at night. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Also, we visited <strong>the Lofoten Islands</strong>. I highly recommend it. They are north of Bodo, just off the Arctic Circle. It was a beautiful place to stay, with mountains and white snow. The beauty of the Fjords is what made it a paradise. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>I also recommend the Jostedalsbreen Park</strong> to anyone visiting Norway. Although the name may be difficult to pronounce once you get there you'll soon see why. This park is undoubtedly one of Scandinavia's most stunning parks. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You can see that outdoor activities are something I enjoy so I wasn't surprised when they told me to hike. It was an interesting 5 hour round trip and the entertainment at my arrival made it all worth it. You can enjoy <strong>the Lysefjord</strong> at its best once you arrive at Preikestolen. , </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You will enjoy a little bit of <strong>The glacier at Briksdal</strong> if you like snow or ice. It is a must-see on your Norway trip. A new snow show, with blue snow and in the natural, will delight you. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> You can also discover the many beautiful fjords in the country </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> It is likely that you are aware that <strong>Fjords</strong> do not exist in Norway. What is a "fjord"? I had the exact same question. You don't need to Google them, these are sea arms that move in the Earth to produce a stunning result. It's possible to appreciate the sea from anywhere without ever having to go on a trip. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Some fjords really caught my attention. You should visit <strong>The Fjord of Dreams</strong>. It is no accident that the place is named that way. It is like something out of a movie. You can find it halfway between Oslo and Bergen, making it a little bit of paradise. It is a paradise of beauty and tranquility, perfect for those who want to enjoy a relaxing holiday. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>The Geiranger Fjord</strong> is another must-see spot. This is the most famous fjord in Norway. From the Ferry bridge, the view is breathtaking. Although we could have stayed just one day, it would be enough to see the Ferry for a month. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Also, I recommend that you <strong>visit Lysefjord</strong> to see the stunning Norwegian scenery. You will be captivated by the 42-kilometer cruise that takes you to this amazing place. </p> <p style="text-align: center;"> </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> What time should I leave for this amazing country? </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You should also know when is the best time to <strong>Discover Norway</strong>. People recommend that you visit Norway between May and September. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> For the rest of this year, I recommend that you stay away from these areas. There are nine months you shouldn't avoid, as some say. It is during low season when it is most fascinating, regardless of the weather or number of visitors. It is a beautiful display of nature's ability to awaken and give its best. </p>
For cellulite, arthritis and sport *Video *le-sport-pour-la-cellulite-et-larthrose*<p style="text-align: justify;"> Most people have known for a while that exercise is important to keep in good shape. This is especially true in cases where you are ill. Some illnesses, such as cancer, require that you continue to exercise in order for your body to stay healthy. Cellulite fighting is another benefit of sports. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> This article was written for two reasons. First, it allows us to discuss sport and cellulite. Second, because I know most people are interested in this topic. The issue of osteoarthritis and sports is another. These are slightly different topics, I'm sorry, but it is important to discuss them. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> Cellulite can be combated with sports </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> I won't go into <strong>cellulite</strong>. This is something I'm not able to answer because most of the cases involve women. It doesn't hurt but it can be very bothersome for the eye and aesthetic. These fat clusters form underneath the skin. They also increase in number, which is a sign of their high rate of accumulation. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Sedentary living is a major cause of cellulite. Poor diet will make your hips and thighs look a lot worse. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>Although physical activity</strong> can make cellulite disappear it's not enough. Sport allows you to increase muscle mass and reduce fat storage. Exercise can also help to increase circulation and prevent fat accumulation. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Cellulite must be treated with multiple methods. As I mentioned, I suggest a healthy diet and massages. Cellulite is not a common problem. To get rid of excess fat, I recommend that you choose the best sports. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> What sport is best to fight cellulite successfully? </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You have many options when it comes to <strong>fighting cellulite</strong>. It is recommended that you walk 30 minutes per day for your general health and wellness. It doesn't have to be far away - you can walk your dog, use the stairs, commute or subway to get there. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> If you are able, I recommend that you engage in a regular sports activity. If you are looking to reduce the amount of cellulite in your body, endurance sports is the best. To ensure endurance, your body must use all its energy resources, particularly the lipid reserves. This is to maintain the required performance. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> To combat cellulite <strong>, I recommend that you consider</strong> weight training. Weight training can help you build muscle, which will reduce the appearance of fat. It also mobilizes your body's resources to create muscle tissue. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Aquagym can also be a great way to combat cellulite. Water makes the body lighter, so you can make longer, more consistent efforts without realizing that you're in water. You can make substantial efforts and use energy. Water also helps to shape your body as cellulite is gone. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Also, I recommend you <strong>exercise</strong>. This is because you'll be closely supervised and have to adhere to a specific program to reduce cellulite. You will soon be able to restore your youthful appearance. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> Exercise is important for osteoarthritis patients </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Many treatments are available to treat osteoarthritis. You should also know that you need to engage in sports to stay healthy, despite any pain this condition can cause. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> People believe that being inactive makes things more easy and will lessen the pain. However, this misconception is common among us all. Regular activity can actually help you <strong>combat the effects of osteoarthritis</strong>. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You will be able to strengthen your muscles, protect your joints and maintain overall good health, including your cardiovascular system. You can also maintain flexibility and range of motion in the affected joints through physical activity, which will stimulate cartilage repair. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> Which sport is best for this situation? </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> It can be difficult to engage in sports when your joints hurt. You will still benefit if you do some form of physical activity without being too hard on yourself. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You can find programs that are specifically designed for osteoarthritis patients. Ask your doctor before you begin. You may be given specific instructions by your doctor. However, there are some things that you can do in every case, like walking for 30 minutes each day. You should also practice the sport gradually in terms of difficulty or duration. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> It is a good idea to stretch regularly in order to maintain flexibility. To protect your joints, strengthening exercises can be a great idea. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> When <strong>engaging in a specific sport</strong> I recommend that you choose non-violent sports that don't cause injury to the body or the joints. If you enjoy being in water, swimming or cycling are options. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You can go hiking and walking if you enjoy outdoor activities. Tai Chi and yoga are gentle options that will allow you to be active but not over-stress your body. You can also try gentle gymnastics to stay in shape. </p>
Japan is a destination you must visit at least once in life *Video *japan-the-destination-at-least-once-in-your-life*<p style="text-align: justify;"> You probably know that I've traveled quite a bit. However, it is something I enjoy doing as well. It's a pleasure to share my favorite things about destinations that I have visited and talk about what they mean to me. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Today, I'm going to be talking about Japan. It is one of my favourite destinations. Although I was unable to return there on my second trip, it is something I plan to do. Japan is the land of rising sun, so plan your trip now. It is an amazing destination, I can assure you. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> You should visit these places </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Without a doubt, the <strong>Tokyo Imperial Palace</strong> is the first place that I would recommend. Although the palace is closed to public for the entire year, it's worth the effort. The palace is only open twice per year so make sure you go. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You are in Tokyo already, so I recommend that you visit the Tokyo Tower. It looks a lot like the Eiffel tower, I'm sure. The red colour and few centimeters difference between the Eiffel Tower and it make the difference. It is best to visit it at night when it glows! </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You should also visit the Bamboo forest in Arashiyama. It is simple bamboo forest, which we think is it. But, it's not. The bamboo is rare at our home, so it makes it one of my favorite places. You should also visit <strong>Kamakura</strong>. It is home to many historical landmarks including the largest seated Buddha anywhere in the world. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> It is amazing to be in this land of rising sun. I couldn't help but wish that I was there to witness this spectacular show. To see a stunning sunrise, I suggest you climb Mount Fuji. It is Japan's highest peak. The climb is possible for everyone, so don't be alarmed. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> To get to know the marine fauna, visit the aquariums </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Also, I recommend that you visit Japan's many aquariums. The country has a lot of marine fauna. These aquariums have many unique species you won't find anywhere else. I have to admit, diving is not something I enjoy. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> If you're in Osaka, I recommend you visit the Osaka Aquarium. The beautiful castle is another great spot. This aquarium is third in size worldwide. There are hundreds of animal species that can be found there. This aquarium is sure to provide you with many interesting experiences to enhance your experience. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You must also visit <strong>Roppongi Hills' Sky Aquarium</strong>, Tokyo. You will most likely pass it during your visit. It is also a great time to see a fascinating show about the area. It isn't one of the big aquariums. However, there are many charms and beautiful animals in this small aquarium. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> The Enoshima Aquarium in Japan is one of Japan's most spectacular aquariums. The aquarium's cave will allow you to see many interesting species. It can feel as though you're being swallowed up by the ocean, but you soon forget about your worries. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> The Marine World Aquarium in Kinosaki, Japan is another aquarium worth visiting. This beautiful location is home to dolphins and fish. The famous Shimonoseki Aquarium puffer fish, which are very fascinating specimens, will be on display. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> It would also be nice to visit <strong>Churaumi Aquarium</strong> in order to view sharks, rays and other aquatic animals. You should also visit this aquarium. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> Japan has many castles that are worth seeing </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> The Osaka castle is the historic symbol of Osaka. It's a must-see landmark in the city. The beauty and grandeur of the palace contrasts with the rest is what I loved about it. This is an image I'll never forget. Its beauty and architecture are still intact, even though the city is being reconstructed. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Also, I recommend that you visit the Hiroshima Castle. It is a must-see on your Japan trip. Hiroshima, Japan's capital city is another must-see. The city's past is well-remembered and hasn't changed in many years. It is still safe to visit today, but don't be alarmed. After the tragedy, the castle was rebuilt. It is now smaller but almost identical to its predecessor. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Also you should go to Himeji Castle . This castle is one of few that have not been rebuilt from its inception. It is this reason that I love the place so much. It has been well preserved by time. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You will visit Matsumoto Castle, which is Japan's oldest wooden castle. You will see why it is Japan's national treasure. Don't be afraid to visit it. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> These pagodas seem to have been lost in the past </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> The architecture in Japan, including their palaces, shrines, and houses is what I love the most. You should not miss out on the many pagodas in Japan. You should visit the Yakushiji Temple especially in the spring when they are at their best. Don't forget your camera! </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>Itsukushima Shrinket</strong> is another pagoda I highly recommend, particularly if you're looking for tranquility and peace. The island is almost directly facing Hiroshima. It is located on an island that faces Hiroshima. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Toshoguo Temple is also a good place to visit. It is located in Ueno park. You can enjoy peace and quiet while exploring this castle. You should also visit the Nara Koen Complex to see the Kofuku Ji temple. This is a wonderful place to explore in Japan. </p>
BZ benches: The secret to saving space in your bedroom or studio *Comfortable and practical, the BZ *the-banquette-bz-lastuce-for-earning-a-place-in-a-room-or-a-studio*<p style="text-align: justify;"> It is common to live in tiny studios when you're a student, or when your budget doesn't allow you to purchase a beautiful apartment. You don't need a roof to cover your head. It's not easy to decorate a tiny space or find furniture that will fit in such an area. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> There are many clever pieces of furniture available that you can use in small rooms. You can also find some decorating tips for such homes. It is not easy to fit everything in one room. This is <strong>The BZ bench</strong>, which I am going to show you today. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> What does a bench BZ mean? </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You might be wondering what a BZ-bench is. It's not an extremely common name, and I have never even heard of it. Although it sounds amazing and interesting, it is actually an old idea that has been rediscovered. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Since the beginning, we've been familiar with the click-beds we love to use in our home. It is still a bit of the same idea that was presented to us today as the bench BZ. We also refer to it accordion. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> The bench BZ actually is a couch bed. But be aware! This sofa bed is not like any other. This piece of furniture has been improved to be more functional and more comfortable than any sofa bed you've ever seen. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> The BZ sofa can be used during the day as any other sofa. You just need to fold the sofa up so it doesn't look like it is your bed. It's a good idea to keep your pants in there, as it can be embarrassing for someone to find them. It is a great piece of furniture to have in your home to greet your guests. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You can make your sofa more comfortable by adding armrests or cushions. This is a great option for small spaces. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> When the day's over, it is time to get to sleep. Simply unfold your sofa and make it into a comfy bed. The BZ sofa is more comfortable than any sofa bed that you have ever used. You will feel the amazing feeling of relaxing in your bed, after a long day at work. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> You can also install it in your home studio if you don't want to. You will find it very useful, I'm sure. </p> <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> Practical and Comfortable - A BZ </h2> <p style="text-align: justify;"> I suggest that you make a BZ-bench in your studio, office, or children's bedroom to create an extra bed to sleep on when your friends visit. It is because of the convenience and comfort that such furniture brings to your daily life. </p> [caption id="attachment_440" align="aligncenter" width="475"] The BZ is synonymous with comfort and practicality! [/caption] <p style="text-align: justify;"> The practical aspect of the BZ bench, as I call it, is the best <strong>couch bed</strong>. The BZ sofa, a convertible sofa that can be used whenever and wherever you need it, is a great example of this. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> BZ Sofa unfolds in accordion style. The BZ sofa is composed of three parts, which can be folded without concern for the bed. You can put it back into the sofa shape by folding it the same way you fold an accordion. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> It can be made into a <strong>2-seater sofa</strong> in most cases. I recommend that you also make it into a 2+1 bed. Furniture like this can be very heavy so you don't know how much. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> The cover can be changed to any color you choose, and can transform into a blanket that keeps you warm at night. The BZ sofa comes with a chest, which you can store your winter blankets and pillows. </p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> The mattress was specially designed to provide comfort.

Noumea: Living in Experience *Living in Noumea: Advantages and Disadvantages *experience-vivre-a-noumea*My lured by New Caledonia's paradisiacal environment and cosmopolitan charm, I decided to move to Noumea. Although there were some failures, I found many positive aspects to my experience. Two years living in New Caledonia's capital, I wanted to share my experiences with you. <strong> Stay in Noumea </strong> . If you already have a booked, <strong> plane tickets </strong> Your luggage is now ready to go <strong> Trip </strong> Go to my article <a href="https://www.district-parthenay.fr/nos-secrets-pour-voyager-en-toute-serenite/"> How to Travel Safely </a> ! <h2> Noumea: What I loved about it </h2> <h3> 1. Its beauty is breathtaking </h3> Noumea, the capital of New Caledonia's southern province is Noumea. It can be found on <strong> Grande Terre </strong> An island located in the middle of large lagoon, bordered with coral reef. The stunning landscapes of the city reveal an amazing fauna and flora that are still very well conserved. Nearly 230ha are preserved in the city. <em> Mangrove </em> Near the coast, you will find mangrove trees that are over 100 years old. The coastline is 120km long and has beautiful beaches. In the background, you will find the New Caledonian archipelago. You can reach it by boat in just a few minutes. <strong> Pine Island </strong> One of the unspoiled areas in archipelago. It is possible to visit during the egg-laying period. <em> Turtle Bay </em> These majestic marine creatures can be viewed at Noumea (a little over 100 kilometers). <h3> <img alt="flore" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-601" height="853" src="http://d88jg5ns.district-parthenay.fr/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/flore.jpg" width="1280"/> 2. Life in France is less stressful than on the mainland </h3> Noumea's pace of life is more laid back. There is an air of relaxation due to the South Pacific's tropical climate. To adapt to changing weather conditions, the people of South Pacific live in the mornings. School starts here earlier than it does in France. Classes begin at 8am, and finish around 3:00pm. There is a brief break in between 11:15am to 1pm. It is common to find water-sport enthusiasts on the beaches in the afternoon. Noumea has a more relaxed atmosphere. Tourists and natives mix at the Place des Cocotiers. Locals are friendly. Making new friends is simple. Caledonians like to be on the same terms. <h3> 3. A society that is full of diversity </h3> Noumea is home to multiculturalism. You can see the different influences in both Noumea's architecture and in its food. The huts are mixed with high-end residential areas. Many Kanaks live in their traditional homes. You can still see buildings from colonization in the middle of Noumea. Noumea's population has many origins. The majority are European. These are mainly urban dwellers. <strong> Caldoches </strong> The descendants of ex-colonials and expatriates that have been living on the island for many generations. These are the <strong> Kanak </strong> The indigenous tribe is a large part of the country's population. There are also many Asian and Oceanian populations. A lot of Melanesians are from French overseas territories like Wallis, Futuna and Tahiti. Leisure activities reflect the cultural diversity of this city. My stay allowed me to see many art galleries and museums, as well as to watch movies. <h2> <img alt="cocotier" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-602" height="960" src="http://d88jg5ns.district-parthenay.fr/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cocotier.jpg" width="640"/> What I did not like about living in Noumea </h2> <h3> 1. A delicate political situation </h3> My stay at Noumea was an opportunity to see the tensions that exist in this archipelago. I was horrified by the tragic events that took place in 1988 at Noumea. <strong> Ouvea cave </strong> They are very much present in the minds of people today. The pro-independence movement fought the loyalists over the question of independence in the wake of colonization. <strong> New Caledonia </strong> 's independence. The French Republic claims New Caledonia's total autonomy. The Noumea Accord stipulates that the native people can vote on the matter. Both the 1987 and 2018 referendums had the same outcome, with both ending in rejection of independence. Insecurity is a result of the uncertain Caledonian situation. <h3> 2. It's a very expensive way to live. </h3> One euro equals approximately 120 when it comes to currency. <strong> Pacific Francs </strong> . The New Caledonian capital is much more costly than the rest of the island or Metropolitan France. The monopoly in many sectors is the main reason for this. Many imported goods will be found in shops. High taxes can significantly increase the price of imported products. Real estate prices are affected by the increase in Noumea's expatriate population.
